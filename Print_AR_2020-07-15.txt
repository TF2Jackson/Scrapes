There number probable reasons higher female religiousness one empathy Females higher empathetic behavior involves interested people  feelings able detect feelings external markers facial expressions. fn ffn  There evidence people high empathy transfer ability world meaning perceive presence  mind   higher power  simply looking around world Accordingly low empathythat stereotypical autismis associated atheism. fn ffn  Another reason may adaptation patriarchy Females sexually select male status highstatus male better able invest offspring meaning likely survive. fn ffn  Until Industrial Revolution wealth status strongly predicted completed fertility case among preindustrial peoples today fn ffn  If males must invest resources female order obtain sexual intercourse want certain offspring investing resources actually result system patriarchy females controlled males male paternity anxiety reduced This system patriarchy tend promoted society  religion divinely ordained possibly patriarchal societies reduce paternity anxiety meaning turn reduce intermale conflict thus causing males internally cooperative And computer models shown societies internally cooperative people likely triumph warfare competing societies. fn ffn  This system patriarchy however would mean females would strongly selected accepting patriarchy thus religious religion would promote. fn ffn  Consequently would religious  arms race  among females order obtain higheststatus males especially kind polygamous societies humans lived history highest status males monopolize desirable females As would expect females strongly prone wishing signal virtue religiosity regarded virtuous signal And would convincingly able signal genuinely believed it. It also clear anyone ever attended BLM protest many involvedwith stereotypical unnatural colored hair screams righteous furyare mentally well By contrast females churches appear sober control. Why traditional religiousness associated mental health  answer lies evolutionary history In understanding evolution religion worth noting combination variety traits would adaptive prehistory. strong Agency OverDetection. strong We cognitive bias towards detecting presence agent behind events Following  Smoke Detector Principle  adaptive assume worst get wrongsuch assume noise wolf rather wind This helps explain might see evidence god world. strong Pattern OverDetection. strong We evolved overdetect causation This adaptive underdetected would put danger wiped able analyze understand world around them. strong Follow Leader. strong We evolved form stronglybonded groups obey authority By working team leader groups likely survive battle group selection. fn ffn  Religions vary extent prominence factors This means although religiousness generally adaptive evolutionary sense promoting individual especially group fitness quite possible maladaptive forms religiousnesswhich promote genetic fitnessto manifest Some devotees might extreme obedience leader pattern overdetection adhering religion harmful followers An obvious would suicide cultssuch notorious Jonestownin devotees inclined follow leader inclined overdetect patterns accept mentally ill man  paranoid worldview kill completely destroying genetic interests. fn ffn  Membership groups associated maladaptive traitssuch schizophrenia bipolar disorderwhereas traditional religiousness genetically associated mental health. relationship religiousness sound mental health makes sense delve little deeper religiousness selected time This also highly relevant later understanding nature Black Lives Matter movement As discussed study  Mutant Says His Heart  There No God   fn ffn  conditions harsh Darwinian selection breakthroughs Industrial Revolution began around  resulting improved public health living conditions meant child mortality fallen around  percent  percent today. fn ffn  High child mortality ensured surviving population strongly adapted ecology Babies mutations made unfitsuch leading poor immune systemwere purged population every generation meaning overall low  mutational load.  Under brutal conditions traditional religionbased around collective worship moral godwas adaptive meaning came selected tandem adaptive traits thus became genetically connected. With breakdown harsh Darwinian selection would expect population display increasing evidence mutational load This would observed secular increases prevalence partly genetic medical conditions. fn ffn  We would also expect development kinds deviations delicately balanced Darwinian religious normdeviations would maladaptive terms group individual selection would attractive people maladaptive traits mental illness Religious suicide cults Jonestown Waco would exemplify process These religious deviants would high mutational loads likely people would survived childhood harsh Darwinian conditions. How know people would survived  In brain  percent genome enormous target mutation meaning physical mutations expected mental mutations well would direct towards deviations adaptive form religiousness Consistent found modern collective worship moral god genetically associated physical mental health negatively associated markers high mutational load including autism physical asymmetry lefthandedness These associated atheism religious deviations paranormal belief inability develop symmetrical phenotype implies poor immune system person poor immune system would use disproportionately bioenergetic resources fight pathogens meaning insufficient resources left ensure symmetry Lefthandedness accepted marker  developmental instability.

Religious revivals appear occur kind situation would lead period religiousness individualsuch stress mortality salienceare experienced relatively suddenly substantial portion society There variation nature revival depending kind people impacted But general dramatic change period difficulty expected lead religious revival kind These charted throughout history interestingly often time lag separating period stress revival itself. Christian evangelists constantly attempting create revivals traveling different communities preaching message conversion redemption However seem able create mass revivals periods significant distress. An examination British revivals th century consistent pattern first major revival twentieth century took place Wales   At time South Wales ravaged industrial unrest unemployment society welfare state Accordingly Welsh workers many already heavily influenced Methodism facing serious hardship realistic possibility destitution. fn ffn  Interesting religious revival World War UK Spanish Flu pandemic immediately followed fn ffn  There however various revivals s lack communications time meant difficult s become national phenomena A major revival East Anglia  focused around socioeconomically deprived fishing communities considerable distress even compared ordinary people recovering Great War following year revivals parts country notably fishing communities northeast Scotland. fn ffn  There major revival Britain s deeply conservative Hebridean islands north west Scotland  This year time elevated distress due real possibility Britain might go war again. fn ffn  There major revival UK World War II next Christian revival concomitant reassertion conservative attitudes came War especially s There revival Hebrides  large numbers people previously especially devout underwent religious experiences became involved church already religious became fervent According revival leader Rev Duncan  late  village Barvas Island Lewis conducted nighttime meeting At  AM morning  buses full people arrived parts island even island Harris People meetings fell trances fainted swayed collapsed floor. fn ffn  felt inspired Holy Spirit go revive Outer Hebrides given stressful conditions time people extremely receptive religiousfervor ways otherwise  been. fn ffn  Wartime rationing cease  could argued point  normal life  finally reasserted itself. fn ffn  In era masscommunication spark needed set nationwide revival came form American pastor Billy Graham  witnessed British rallies took place   postwar religious fervor estimated roughly  percent London population attended Billy Graham rally  percent Glasgow population so. fn ffn  In   people packed Glasgow stadium attend single service conducted Billy Graham. fn ffn  aware relationship quantitatively tested rule British Modern History religious revivals seem manifest areas elevated mortality salience consequence impoverishment directly famine highly stressful phenomena. What happening terms individual masspsychology revivals  As discussed quotidian stable religiousnessin religious timeis correlated sound mental health Even religious people mentally healthy however go periods stress mortality salience may become religious They may even undergo forms known  religious experience.  Religious experiences profound psychological experiences person may overwhelmed feeling God  love even hear God  voice believe seen Him In making sense kinds experiences American neuroscientist Andrew Newberg colleagues argue mind two effective systems calming arousal When either systems pushed extremes meditation hyperarousalboth achieved via religious servicesthey argue dangerous body Accordingly system hits leading alternative states consciousness intense psychological experiences. fn ffn  British biologist Richard Dawkins suggested may provoked way stress makes us highly instinctive thus prone religious belief anyway Dawkins also argues also evolved overdetect agency mentioned mistake distant rock wolf lost nothing make opposite mistake may killed Accordingly times intense stress much likely mistake unidentified sound voice God time find calming system would This would lead intense religious experience combined feelings relief joy. fn ffn  Undergoing mild religious experiencesknown  spiritual  experiencesis . heritable Undergoing intense religious experiences approximately . heritable. fn ffn  This high heritability might imply ability undergo religious experience extremely beneficial evolutionary terms combats stress due profound nature keeps low negative feelings substantial period time afterwards. However must distinguish  religious experience   conversion experience  and also  religious   hyperreligious  going phase intensely religious American psychologist William James  distinguished religion  sick soul   healthy mindedness.  religion healthy mindedness characterized relatively mild religious experiences religion  sick soul  however marked dramatic conversion experiences occur times intense stress. fn ffn  Those lead religious revivalspeople Billy Grahamcan regarded constantly  hyperreligious.  As already noted associated either schizophrenia severely depressive personality Psychological studies lead religious revivals found display evidence pathological traits They require absolute structure order fanatical religiousness provides order allay anxiety frequently undergo intense religious experiences. fn ffn  Such nature revival  leaders.  It may beneficial healthy society able maintain small percentage lunatics precisely able inspire fervent religiosity people religiosity traditionally means promoting ethnocentrism In regard noted tribal shamans tend kinds psychological characteristics modernday charismatic leaders. fn ffn  But followers become followers revival  What psychology  Religious revivals characterized  conversion  type religious experience person undergoes kind psychological breakdown extent adopts new identity  Christian   real Christian  way somehow prior revival. fn ffn  They consequently go transient phrase hyperreligiosity Transient hyperreligiosity associated high Neuroticism fn ffn  bipolar disorder bouts depression also predict periods extreme religious fervor schizophrenia. fn ffn  Schizophrenia milder forms also elevated times stress anxiety. fn ffn  There range severity schizophreniatype conditions Mild symptoms summarized  schizoid personality.  This characterized anhedonia inability experience joy apathy More severe  schizotypal personality  schizoid symptoms accompanied social anxiety paranoid ideation unconventional paranoid beliefs sometimes psychosis Diagnosable schizophrenia particularly severe manifestation characteristics. fn ffn  Having undergone conversion experience found associated prior experience high anxiety Neuroticism traits. fn ffn  When people suffer PostTraumatic Stress associated high Neuroticism develop specific kind religiosity known  spiritual struggle   negative religious coping.  Those undergo believe God punishing sins plead God intervene world project hostility towards outgroup members  Positive religious coping  cross insomuch involves conversion also involves belief God forgiven purified sins. fn ffn  So people high Neuroticismand even harsh Darwinian conditions prevalent  would population variance traitare likely become part religious revivals They feel stress acutely accordingly likely become extremely religious aftermath periods intense societal distress Females score higher males Neuroticism For reason alone would predict females would play noticeable part religious revivals. fn ffn  Consistent studies religious revivals U.S. found  white black women among visible participants religious revivals converts wept wailed writhed fainted received God  grace.  fn ffn  Neuroticism tends decrease age males But females Neuroticism decreases age adolescence point increases possibly due adaptive need worry one  children This seen obviously among university students females particular tend suffer mental health problems various kinds often recovered time mids. fn ffn Neuroticism women begins decline early adulthood. fn ffn  For reason well due higher general religiousness would expect females midteens mids attracted religious revivals In line prediction detailed  came forward  receive God  forgiveness Billy Graham  British rallies In London  percent female  percent age  In Glasgow  percent women  percent age . fn ffn  Even sufficiently Neurotic undergo religious experiences expected influenced religious revival appears sufficiently popular Neuroticism predicts extrinsic religiousness religious outward conformity. fn ffn  People high Neuroticism fear judged negatively even ostracized failure conform meaning may fake religious fervor even  actually feel This means religious revivals become particularly prominent envelop people far lower Neuroticism see  slain Holy Spirit.  Accordingly popular revivals generate kind group hysteria thus appear far popular really This obvious consider many celebrities felt compelled jump bandwagon Black Lives Matter. So nature  religion   religious revivals  clear minds explore  religious  nature Black Lives Matter protests There obvious parallels thcentury religious revivalssuch spearheaded Billy Grahamand Black Lives Matter revival leaders movement extreme  liberals  with clearly associated mental instability conservatism traditional religiosity correlated mental stability. fn ffn   revival  taken place wake period elevated mortality salience words response stress Those drawn politically liberal associated mental instability. fn ffn  In many respects Multiculturalism argued secular  replacement religion  Christianityand perhaps even kind Christian sect argument made regard Marxism even kinds Romantic Nationalism. Traditional Christianity based around series dogmas must accept order regarded Christian achieve salvation These dogmas sometimes logically incoherentsuch Trinityor require acceptance truthclaims proved reasonable basis extraordinarily improbable However signal intellectual submission religious community accepting This regarded purpose tests loyalty In much way Multiculturalism requires accept dogmas empirically inaccurate patently nonsensical race differences intelligence everyone  equal.  Christianity also tends towards idolizing  marginalized.  It preaches  last shall first  encourages followers empower supposedly marginalized humble embracing kind sacred poverty Similarly Marxism idolizes dispossessed form  worker  Romantic nationalism worships  peasant  Multiculturalism espoused Whites idolizes nonWhites different areculturally geneticallyfrom Whites worthy reverence There evidence humansbeing evolved tightly structured groupshave two fundamental instincts one towards climbing social hierarchy towards equality groups relatively equal tend avoid collapsing discord. fn ffn  Thus religions preach  equality  highly psychologically attractive especially close top hierarchy fear able get This consistent evidence males physically strongand thus would likely ascend prehistoric hierarchy via winning fights sexually selected forare likely hold conservative views specifically favor hierarchy inequality. fn ffn  third key point Multiculturalism common Christianity though pagan religions Hinduism salience  guilt.  In general  guilt   shame  function make people  know place  thus conform behave prosocial cooperative ways Accordingly group adopts religion imbued feelings optimum degree would likely outcompete groups. Christianity religion  guilt  extremely important  central biblical message  one theologian put it. fn ffn  According Christian dogmas humanity  Fallen  consequence  Original Sin.  In words God perfect allbenevolent whereas humanity inherently sinful bad living sinful Fallen world Indeed cast world Paradise punishment wickedness way humanity gain salvation forgiveness admit sinful humbly worship God follow commands His Church Worldly success sense something feel guiltyunless certain God blessed successbecause implies insufficiently humble failing sufficiently repent wickedness.

Shame though less obvious also germane Christianity replacement religions Those refused conform Christianity could  shamed  devilworshippers might bring God  anger community shunned accordingly Those  take knee  George Floyd remain silent instead publicly stating support Black Lives Matter shamed possible  racists  term abuse implying adherent religious community You  Other.  This membership community based around adherence dogmas around bloodbonds case pagan religions many forms nationalism. fn ffn  key difference Church Multiculturalism Christianity godno nonphysical existence Moreover Black Lives Matter represents extremely  spiteful  form religiosity sense  appear  forgiveness.  In Billy Graham rallies could  step forward  forgiven sins In Black Lives Matter rallies  matter many times  take knee  forgiveness sin White You must simply learn live guilt slightly assuaging ever often empower nonWhites. As previously discussed conceive two distinct kinds religion selected centuries Darwinian conditionsthat tend involve collective worship moral godand deviate norm Due way mental health religiousness coselected Darwinian conditions explored  traditional religiosity  positively associated mental health deviations itsuch New Age affectations belief paranormalare associated anxiety depression either ongoing periodic People high mental instability expected become highly religious wake crisis low traditional religiosity well fervently leftwing correlates high mental instability Accordingly would expect peopleselfidentified  liberals  to become extremely religious terms religious deviation wake Covid pandemic appear seeing In previous situations gravity overwhelming majority British population Christian believed varying degrees doctrines This would meant relationship traditional Christian mental stability would much weaker case It also meant revivals Christian nature religious belief even kind mentally unstable people tend undergo intense religious experiences As already noted specific form religiosity found manifest among mentally unstable people suffering high levels stress  Spiritual Struggle.  Those felt Holy Spirit revival would general relatively high Neuroticism something would soothed temporarily religious experience Usually Christian zeal would temporary It would longer psychologically required period stress recovered time factor elevating anxiety intolerable levels would dissipated. In  especially younger people religion Multiculturalism Christianity Christianity religion shrinking minority Consequently would expect variant kind revival outlined occur wake Covid especially among people Its leaders Christian revivals would mentally unstable people However many  followers  caught revival would prone mental instability would going particularly acute phase anxiety As Christian revival feelings would alleviated collective experiencein instance  Black Lives Matter  in would feel sense certainty morally superior better  racist  people part creating paradise Earth Once anxietyreducing feelings induced wore people would longer subject acute mortality salience would return much less fervent believers Church Multiculturalism. We would expect revival pronounced among Multiculturalists among Christians Social Justice Warriors irreligious liberal correlate mental instability  Christians  conservative religious associated mental stability Accordingly world remnant Christianity associated sound mindedness Multiculturalist revival wake pandemic becomes far probable Christian onethough still may Christian one kind near future We would expect Multiculturalist revival elevated among young peoplebecause people go period relatively high mental instability young adultsand particular among young females females religious males prone depression anxiety Multiculturalism  new religion  the  new morality  and thus females would evolved want signal extent adherence ultimately psychologically adapted polygamous societies must compete highest status males strongly signaling religiosity sexual faithfulness. fn ffn  Females also evolved patriarchal society decisions tend made fathers husbands With breakdown patriarchy argued would expect femalesespecially young femalesto make particularly maladaptive decisions. fn ffn  These would include strongly aligning religion seeks destroy ethnic group effectively encouragers childless. It noted relatively religious societies females tend politically conservative males seemingly females religious religion promotes  traditional  values God However influence traditional religiousness breaks female propensity towards higher empathyand thus leftism antitraditionalismbegins manifest In  Britain women born s conservative men age However women born s less conservative males age. fn ffn  These younger women longer influenced traditional religious ideas tend promote leftist onesincluding altruism towards competing ethnic groupswith kind religious zeal One commentator astutely termed  New Church Ladies  evoking subterranean religious quality much contemporary female discourse. fn ffn  Traditional religiousness took female propensity strongly believe God engage religious worship focused adaptive form religiosity God promoted groupselected values With breakdown religion left females tending religiously fervent high generalized empathy thus attracted Multiculturalism leftism Females also higher males Agreeableness Conscientiousness Neuroticism thus social conformity. fn ffn  So reason well would expect heavily involved New Church younger females inculcated. It observed highly educated young peoplethose postgraduate degreesare significantly overrepresented among Black Lives Matter activists. fn ffn  One possible explanation thisbeyond fact university Humanities Social Science departments increasingly indoctrination factories leftist ideas fn ffn  is positive relationship Neuroticism academic success university especially combined high Conscientiousness impulse control rulefollowing fn ffn  This possibly anxiety acts motivator towards diligence Neuroticism means desire greater certainty nature world believe attain higher education In Neuroticism predicts extrinsic religiousness fn ffn  that outward religious conformitywe would expect nonSJWs relatively high traits drawn dominant public revival due fear conforming leading compete strongly outwardly conform. difference British religious awakenings th century Black Lives Matter anarchy involved BLM activists flagrantly breaking law engaging dangerous behavior rioting inciting perpetual disorder  No Justice No Peace  engaging iconoclasm toppling statues desecrating memorials In sense clearer comparison found Peasants War took place Germanspeaking states s early days Reformation There multiple reasons Reformation began one period elevated mortality salience There severe famine Germany  . fn ffn  Reports indicate violent Protestant mobs would strip Catholic Churches valuables destroy idols As Black Lives Matter educated people heavily overrepresented among early Protestant iconoclaststhey mainly socalled  middling sort.  fn ffn  Protestant leaders would oppose iconoclasm publicly stating idols removed permission proper authorities But occurred Britain  Swiss authorities preemptively removed icons way halting public disorder also way appeasing Protestant leaders In June  Zurich churches closed order prevent maelstrom. fn ffn  In words Black Lives Matter particularly pronounced religious revival In s occurred part due particularly difficult conditions In  may cause moderately difficult conditions plus growing percentage young people partly genetic reasons underpinned increasing mutational load increasingly suffer depression anxiety therefore psychologically cope would historically regarded quite normal levels mortality salience Contemporary young people increasingly situation  evolutionary mismatch  whereunder influence modern antitraditional ideologies overparenting education decreasingly socialized children manner norm harsh Darwinian conditions This shown lead severe behavioral problems nonhuman animals fn ffn  explore issue detail below.

An examination British revivals th century consistent pattern first major revival twentieth century took place Wales   At time South Wales ravaged industrial unrest unemployment society welfare state Accordingly Welsh workers many already heavily influenced Methodism facing serious hardship realistic possibility destitution. fn ffn  Interesting religious revival World War UK Spanish Flu pandemic immediately followed fn ffn  There however various revivals s lack communications time meant difficult s become national phenomena A major revival East Anglia  focused around socioeconomically deprived fishing communities considerable distress even compared ordinary people recovering Great War following year revivals parts country notably fishing communities northeast Scotland. fn ffn  There major revival Britain s deeply conservative Hebridean islands north west Scotland  This year time elevated distress due real possibility Britain might go war again. fn ffn  There major revival UK World War II next Christian revival concomitant reassertion conservative attitudes came War especially s There revival Hebrides  large numbers people previously especially devout underwent religious experiences became involved church already religious became fervent According revival leader Rev Duncan  late  village Barvas Island Lewis conducted nighttime meeting At  AM morning  buses full people arrived parts island even island Harris People meetings fell trances fainted swayed collapsed floor. fn ffn  felt inspired Holy Spirit go revive Outer Hebrides given stressful conditions time people extremely receptive religiousfervor ways otherwise  been. fn ffn  Wartime rationing cease  could argued point  normal life  finally reasserted itself. fn ffn  In era masscommunication spark needed set nationwide revival came form American pastor Billy Graham  witnessed British rallies took place   postwar religious fervor estimated roughly  percent London population attended Billy Graham rally  percent Glasgow population so. fn ffn  In   people packed Glasgow stadium attend single service conducted Billy Graham. fn ffn  aware relationship quantitatively tested rule British Modern History religious revivals seem manifest areas elevated mortality salience consequence impoverishment directly famine highly stressful phenomena. What happening terms individual masspsychology revivals  As discussed quotidian stable religiousnessin religious timeis correlated sound mental health Even religious people mentally healthy however go periods stress mortality salience may become religious They may even undergo forms known  religious experience.  Religious experiences profound psychological experiences person may overwhelmed feeling God  love even hear God  voice believe seen Him In making sense kinds experiences American neuroscientist Andrew Newberg colleagues argue mind two effective systems calming arousal When either systems pushed extremes meditation hyperarousalboth achieved via religious servicesthey argue dangerous body Accordingly system hits leading alternative states consciousness intense psychological experiences. fn ffn  British biologist Richard Dawkins suggested may provoked way stress makes us highly instinctive thus prone religious belief anyway Dawkins also argues also evolved overdetect agency mentioned mistake distant rock wolf lost nothing make opposite mistake may killed Accordingly times intense stress much likely mistake unidentified sound voice God time find calming system would This would lead intense religious experience combined feelings relief joy. fn ffn  Undergoing mild religious experiencesknown  spiritual  experiencesis . heritable Undergoing intense religious experiences approximately . heritable. fn ffn  This high heritability might imply ability undergo religious experience extremely beneficial evolutionary terms combats stress due profound nature keeps low negative feelings substantial period time afterwards. However must distinguish  religious experience   conversion experience  and also  religious   hyperreligious  going phase intensely religious American psychologist William James  distinguished religion  sick soul   healthy mindedness.  religion healthy mindedness characterized relatively mild religious experiences religion  sick soul  however marked dramatic conversion experiences occur times intense stress. fn ffn  Those lead religious revivalspeople Billy Grahamcan regarded constantly  hyperreligious.  As already noted associated either schizophrenia severely depressive personality Psychological studies lead religious revivals found display evidence pathological traits They require absolute structure order fanatical religiousness provides order allay anxiety frequently undergo intense religious experiences. fn ffn  Such nature revival  leaders.  It may beneficial healthy society able maintain small percentage lunatics precisely able inspire fervent religiosity people religiosity traditionally means promoting ethnocentrism In regard noted tribal shamans tend kinds psychological characteristics modernday charismatic leaders. fn ffn  But followers become followers revival  What psychology  Religious revivals characterized  conversion  type religious experience person undergoes kind psychological breakdown extent adopts new identity  Christian   real Christian  way somehow prior revival. fn ffn  They consequently go transient phrase hyperreligiosity Transient hyperreligiosity associated high Neuroticism fn ffn  bipolar disorder bouts depression also predict periods extreme religious fervor schizophrenia. fn ffn  Schizophrenia milder forms also elevated times stress anxiety. fn ffn  There range severity schizophreniatype conditions Mild symptoms summarized  schizoid personality.

Those undergo believe God punishing sins plead God intervene world project hostility towards outgroup members  Positive religious coping  cross insomuch involves conversion also involves belief God forgiven purified sins. fn ffn  So people high Neuroticismand even harsh Darwinian conditions prevalent  would population variance traitare likely become part religious revivals They feel stress acutely accordingly likely become extremely religious aftermath periods intense societal distress Females score higher males Neuroticism For reason alone would predict females would play noticeable part religious revivals. fn ffn  Consistent studies religious revivals U.S. found  white black women among visible participants religious revivals converts wept wailed writhed fainted received God  grace.  fn ffn  Neuroticism tends decrease age males But females Neuroticism decreases age adolescence point increases possibly due adaptive need worry one  children This seen obviously among university students females particular tend suffer mental health problems various kinds often recovered time mids. fn ffn Neuroticism women begins decline early adulthood. fn ffn  For reason well due higher general religiousness would expect females midteens mids attracted religious revivals In line prediction detailed  came forward  receive God  forgiveness Billy Graham  British rallies In London  percent female  percent age  In Glasgow  percent women  percent age . fn ffn  Even sufficiently Neurotic undergo religious experiences expected influenced religious revival appears sufficiently popular Neuroticism predicts extrinsic religiousness religious outward conformity. fn ffn  People high Neuroticism fear judged negatively even ostracized failure conform meaning may fake religious fervor even  actually feel This means religious revivals become particularly prominent envelop people far lower Neuroticism see  slain Holy Spirit.  Accordingly popular revivals generate kind group hysteria thus appear far popular really This obvious consider many celebrities felt compelled jump bandwagon Black Lives Matter. So nature  religion   religious revivals  clear minds explore  religious  nature Black Lives Matter protests There obvious parallels thcentury religious revivalssuch spearheaded Billy Grahamand Black Lives Matter revival leaders movement extreme  liberals  with clearly associated mental instability conservatism traditional religiosity correlated mental stability. fn ffn   revival  taken place wake period elevated mortality salience words response stress Those drawn politically liberal associated mental instability. fn ffn  In many respects Multiculturalism argued secular  replacement religion  Christianityand perhaps even kind Christian sect argument made regard Marxism even kinds Romantic Nationalism. Traditional Christianity based around series dogmas must accept order regarded Christian achieve salvation These dogmas sometimes logically incoherentsuch Trinityor require acceptance truthclaims proved reasonable basis extraordinarily improbable However signal intellectual submission religious community accepting This regarded purpose tests loyalty In much way Multiculturalism requires accept dogmas empirically inaccurate patently nonsensical race differences intelligence everyone  equal.  Christianity also tends towards idolizing  marginalized.

In general  guilt   shame  function make people  know place  thus conform behave prosocial cooperative ways Accordingly group adopts religion imbued feelings optimum degree would likely outcompete groups. Christianity religion  guilt  extremely important  central biblical message  one theologian put it. fn ffn  According Christian dogmas humanity  Fallen  consequence  Original Sin.

We would expect revival pronounced among Multiculturalists among Christians Social Justice Warriors irreligious liberal correlate mental instability  Christians  conservative religious associated mental stability Accordingly world remnant Christianity associated sound mindedness Multiculturalist revival wake pandemic becomes far probable Christian onethough still may Christian one kind near future We would expect Multiculturalist revival elevated among young peoplebecause people go period relatively high mental instability young adultsand particular among young females females religious males prone depression anxiety Multiculturalism  new religion  the  new morality  and thus females would evolved want signal extent adherence ultimately psychologically adapted polygamous societies must compete highest status males strongly signaling religiosity sexual faithfulness. fn ffn  Females also evolved patriarchal society decisions tend made fathers husbands With breakdown patriarchy argued would expect femalesespecially young femalesto make particularly maladaptive decisions. fn ffn  These would include strongly aligning religion seeks destroy ethnic group effectively encouragers childless. It noted relatively religious societies females tend politically conservative males seemingly females religious religion promotes  traditional  values God However influence traditional religiousness breaks female propensity towards higher empathyand thus leftism antitraditionalismbegins manifest In  Britain women born s conservative men age However women born s less conservative males age. fn ffn  These younger women longer influenced traditional religious ideas tend promote leftist onesincluding altruism towards competing ethnic groupswith kind religious zeal One commentator astutely termed  New Church Ladies  evoking subterranean religious quality much contemporary female discourse. fn ffn  Traditional religiousness took female propensity strongly believe God engage religious worship focused adaptive form religiosity God promoted groupselected values With breakdown religion left females tending religiously fervent high generalized empathy thus attracted Multiculturalism leftism Females also higher males Agreeableness Conscientiousness Neuroticism thus social conformity. fn ffn  So reason well would expect heavily involved New Church younger females inculcated.
