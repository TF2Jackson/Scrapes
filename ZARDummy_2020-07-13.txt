In order to have myth, what is needed is that the culture in which it appears would be…</p>, <p>In order to have myth, what is needed is that the culture in which it appears would be a mythological one. This culture supposes a complex group of mythical categories, among them those of time, space and causality. Mythoid lacks the transcendental character of myth, it isn’t, above all, overlapped with the totality of the culture in which it works. It is, in certain sense, isolated and could even oppose essential aspects of a given culture, but possess the fundamental characters of myth. (Miro Quesada Cantuarias, 1986:84-86). As exposed, <strong>myth</strong>, understood as a <em>fact or event which does not have empirical correlate</em>, is differentiated from <strong>mythoid</strong>, by the socio-cultural framework in which it is produced, by which in contemporaneity we would talk more of the generation of mythoids than myths, given that our current culture is found inside of a logocratic (reason) framework eminently and not a mythocratic one.</p>, <p>Following the aforementioned, <strong>one of the mythoids of our contemporaneity is configured in the belief in the fact that science enjoys of an absolute neutrality</strong> in which <em>scientific research</em> (<em>creation of explicative theories</em>) and <em>technological application</em> (<em>execution of theories already given to concrete cases</em>) are not just one. Disconnected, but instead they are at the same time, estranged from external powers which could exert influence in them.</p>, <p><strong>This mythoid has a clear origin in Popperian vision inside of the philosophy of science</strong>, in which precisely the separation between scientific research and technological application is made. For Popper (1970), scientific research has, as such, an intrinsic value which is guided by determined norms of methodological character that could have a moral content, insofar as the objective of the investigation is the discovery, and thus the results of such research also have that inherent value, but are neutral regarding the moral. That one could make good or bad use from the results of a scientific research <em>a-posteriori</em> is an entirely different thing. So, the scientist has two obligations, to follow the moral requirements of the very same scientific praxis (the scientist as scientist), and to limit himself to foresee the possible uses of his results and denounce its bad praxis (the scientist as citizen).</p>, <p>This Popperian approach, which is the traditional one, opposes the historic-sociological approach of epistemologists like Bernal (1939) and Richta (1971), where it is remarked that by the nature of the scientific research, the scientist –in effect– has a double responsibility, to follow the norms of the scientific method, but above all to involve himself in an active way in the changing of society in order for science to fulfill its role of serving mankind, insofar as one is conscious that scientific knowledge could be used both in order to liberate and in order oppress mankind. These are symptomatic facts which are derived from the lacking of the very same social system to which science serves. Meaning, scientific research and technological application are not separated concepts, but instead they keep an intrinsic relationship.</p>, <p>This last point is reaffirmed by the fact that in the praxis of scientific research, the search for some theories or others and the choice between them is not an entirely free enterprise, remembering Quintanilla (1978), regulated exclusively by the canons of objectivity and in service of truth, as the unmistakable reality is that the scientist is a wage worker whose priorities of research are given as such to an order of priority which is established by particular interests which are the ones who direct, what things can be researched and what things are left relegated, “to the extent, for example, that research devoted to a determined topic are financed and not others, etc” (1978:54). As was exposed, “<strong>it is clear that we must renounce the comfortable consolation or illusion that science, in itself, has guaranteed autonomy and value despite the wrong applications that would be made of it circumstantially or despite its historical insertion in an unjust society” (1978:56).</strong><strong><br/> </strong></p>, <p>MIRO QUESADA CANTUARIAS, Francisco.

As memory gets mixed with myth, these events are imagined as popular liberations. Mexico’s “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinco_de_Mayo">Cinco de Mayo</a>,” which might soon displace the Fourth in prominence in the United States, is emblematic in this respect.</p>, <p>But the Fourth of July—as well as France’s Bastille Day of July 14—are holidays of an entirely different character (whatever surface similarities they might share with others).</p>, <p>America and France are the twin “proposition nations” of the Western occident. (This sibling rivalry explains much about the popularity of France-bashing and <em>l’antiamericanisme</em> in opposing countries.) Their “national” days are unique in the world in that they celebrate historical events that were cast, at their very inceptions, as liberal advancements for all humankind.</p>, <p>Today, of course, every nation-state on earth—from Nigeria to North Korea—mouthes some sort of “human rights” mumbo-jumbo. But the U.S. and France are exceptional in that they emerged as direct ideological expressions of the Enlightenment, and occurred at a critical moment in its history. One hundred years after the death of Spinoza, the French and American Revolutions marked the point at which Enlightenment values left the realm of philosophy (and what could be called the 17th-century “radical fringe”) and entered the realm of state-making and geopolitics. Both Revolutions would, in turn, occur some 125 years before the Great War definitively ended the Old Order. Every state thereafter would be “American,” the vestiges of aristocracy and monarchy persisting only as tourist attractions.</p>, <p>“The Rights of Man” . . . “the pursuit of happiness” . . . “inalienable rights . . . endowed by our Creator” . . . The great slogans and myths of 1776 and 1789 have a quaint ring to them today. They hail from an older phase of the Left, and thus have become, as it were, “conservative.”</p>, <p>These platitudes function like dogma and form the unexamined basis of political action and speech. This is most obvious through a familiar political shorthand; in the words of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FOO3OJYbTU">Congressman Paul Ryan</a>, America is “more than just a place . . . America is an <em>idea</em>.” (As geography is thrown out the window, so is race, people, culture, history, and more.) Ryan’s meme is reiterated across the spectrum—from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg3Xzh2cXD8">rock star’s urgings</a> that Americans be “one” with the world, to the inaugural addresses of Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama. Much of political discourse in America involves politicians accusing rivals of not believing in the American dogma hard enough.</p>, <p>To be an American is to be committed to liberty, equality, and individual autonomy—perhaps even to have left one’s home and people in the name of such principles. America’s highest ideal is, in a way, an <em>anti-ideal</em>—that the state shall <em>not</em> express a people’s spirit and history, a source of wisdom or tradition, or a vision of something greater, more dominant and powerful than an individual. The character of America is imagined as an endless <em>tabula rasa</em> or Etch-a-Sketch; it gets written on, but always returns to zero.</p>, <p>The “Founding Fathers,” as they are know, are revered not so much as martial heroes but as the wise designers of the world’s greatest legal mechanism. There seems to be no parallel in other Occidental cultures to the reverence of the Supreme Court, as a set of nine Talmudic Judges who, depending on your persuasion, will either divine the Constitution’s One True Law or else view it as a living will.</p>, <p>Other countries might have <em>negative</em> national consciousnesses. Germans, for instance, have internalized de-Nazification. But Germans remain, despite it all, self-consciously German. Americans, on the contrary, are <em>nothing</em> . . . they’re always starting over . . . they like to tell themselves they have an unbounded future, but only at the cost of never having a past.</p>, <p>One can be an American and also be Roman Catholic . . . a Muslim . . . a Buddhist . . . or a trans-gendered performance artist. American society is, indeed, encouraged to fragment into as many pieces as possible. So long as no identity, ideal, or meaning predominates over others; so long as every identity ultimately wants the same.</p>, <p>Religion in America, particularly Protestant Christianity, has rarely opposed this anti-identity; at critical moments, it has reenforced it. There is a “storybook” history to the many fanatics, who, choosing to abandon their homes and cultures, sought to create a “new Israel” in the New World. What we call “tradition,” they called “corruption” and “poison.”</p>, <p>One could imagine an alternative reality in which American religious institutions had opposed the 1776 Revolution (or at least had been highly skeptical of it), urging loyalty to mother country and mother church. Instead, the 18th-century pulpit was a place of revolutionary fervor. Jefferson’s Independence Declaration had resonated with—and was, indeed, continuous with—a whole series of “compact” beginnings for Christian Americans, who in a spirit of Hebraic separatism, desired to break with Europe.</p>, <p>The Europeans had been Germans . . . Gauls . . . Russians . . . Lombards . . . Britons before they were Christians. In their national consciousnesses, they could remember conversion experiences. Americans, on the contrary, were Christians before they were Americans.</p>, <p>One could counter that the American dogma is all rhetorical—that the Founders, some of the wealthiest men on the continent at the time, sought to secure an aristocratic order, that American society has been informed by ethnic, political, and monetary agendas, etc.</p>, <p>But to understand America, one must understand its <em>outcome</em>—that there are certain impulses and implications that only become clear later on (ironically, when the entity has reached its end point). Today, the United States has achieved the most robust and most popular civic religion that explicitly denies its racial, historical, and civilizational identity. This <em>spiritual</em> negation is more devastating than the displacement of the founding stock through mass immigration.</p>, <p>Our perspective is of living in America, without being of it. As we escape America’s assumptions, we can look upon the entity objectively.</p>, <p>A century and a half ago, Alexander Stephens, Vice-President of the Confederate States of America, was faced with the prospect of the victory or annihilation of his nation and fledgling state in what is now referred to as the American Civil War.</p>, <p>In his greatest address, “The Cornerstone of the Confederacy,” he did not speak (mendaciously) about “states rights” or any kind of Constitutional legality. He instead cut to the heart of the social order he was opposing. He stressed that the Confederacy was based on the conclusion that Thomas Jefferson was wrong; the “cornerstone” of the new state was the “physical, philosophical, and moral truth” of human inequality.</p>, <p>Ours, too, should be a declaration of difference and distance—”We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created unequal.” In the wake of the old world, this will be our proposition.</p>, <p><em>This article was originally published on July 4, 2014.</em></p>, <p>With the rise of the BLM movement, we are not just witnessing protests and riots but the birth of an old/new religion. Summary The Black Lives Matter protests are best…</p>, <p>The Black Lives Matter protests are best understood as a religious revival, emerging from the United States but global in scale. This new religion is “Multiculturalism” and based on institutions and ideals outside traditional churches; however, its structure and sacraments strikingly resemble those of Christianity. It could even be considered a kind of heresy.</p>, <p>Religious revivals take place in the wake of wars and disasters, periods of elevated stress and widespread angst. They are spearheaded by and attractive to people who are relatively high in neurotic traits such as anxiety. Their disturbed mental states are, temporarily, alleviated by the religious experiences that take place through these revivals—with religion, more generally, being an adaptation that allows us to cope with an unpredictable and traumatic world.</p>, <p>Leftists and atheists, of course, proudly reject traditional religion and sexual morality, and we should appreciate the irony of a “religious revival” capturing their hearts and minds. However, as a group, leftists and atheists are high in mental instability—especially those who are young and female—and thus they are highly susceptible to the religious <em>experience</em>, if not religion as it has been historically understood.</p>, <p>Following the Industrial Revolution and the exploitation of fossil fuels, the world became immensely wealthier, healthier, and more comfortable, and the harsh Darwinian selection pressures that characterized previous ages subsided. One of the most impactful consequences of this is the dramatic decrease in childhood mortality. Thus, millions of people with high levels of mutations, who would not have survived childhood in previous times, walk among us in the postmodern age. These “spiteful mutants” have managed to bring about the collapse of traditional religion—which is associated with mental and physical health and evolutionary success. They have spread Multiculturalism as a religion in its place. The result is a Multiculturalist revival, where 70 years ago there would have been a Christian one.</p>, <p>Imagine there’s no countries <br/>It isn’t hard to do <br/>Nothing to kill or die for <br/>And no religion, too <br/>Imagine all the people <br/>Living life in peace <br/>You, you may say I’m a dreamer <br/>But I’m not the only one <br/>I hope someday you will join us <br/>And the world will be as one <br/><cite><strong>—“Imagine,” John Lennon</strong></cite> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement swept through the Western World beginning in May 2020 after the accidental death of African-American criminal George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. The initial result was widespread riots and looting by African-Americans in Minneapolis, followed by similar scenes in other places. But this quickly morphed into an ideological movement—under the already extant slogan “Black Lives Matter”<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="ffn1">1</a></sup>—in which a kind of anarchy swept through American cities, encouraged by Social Justice Warriors<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="ffn2">2</a></sup> and, to a large extent, the leftist media and political establishment. A kind of hysteria appeared to take hold among White Americans, including politicians and even police officers.</p>, <p></p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8jNcFfICVic" width="560"></iframe></p>, <p></p>, <p>Flagrantly breaking the “lock down,” which had been in action for two months due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Whites gathered in the streets and knelt in the name of George Floyd. Many police officers publicly engaged in this deferential behavior, often holding out their open hands to signify their willingness to make themselves defenseless. White Americans were filmed not just kneeling before Blacks but symbolically washing their feet.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="ffn3">3</a></sup> The riots were stated, by the media, to be “largely peaceful” even as buildings were aflame behind them or as White news reporters were physically attacked by rampaging mobs. There were calls to abolish the police and even for complete anarchy, under the slogan “No Justice, No Peace.”</p>, <p> </p>, <p>The hysteria quickly spread to other Western countries. There were Black riots— assisted by White SJWs—on the streets of central London. White news reporters were attacked live on air. British police, in front of the gates of Downing Street, knelt before Black protestors rather than arrest them for breaking the lockdown and for rioting, as English Law demanded. Companies began to signal their support for “Black Lives Matter,” with those who were slow to do so being criticized as “racist” because, according to one slogan, “Silence is Violence.” In a BLM protest in Helsinki, the overwhelmingly White and female “protestors” didn’t merely kneel but lay prostrate on the ground in order to signal total submission and deference. Young females posted videos of themselves online renouncing their Whiteness, showing their “solidarity” with BLM. In one extreme case, a woman smeared herself in excrement as a sign of abasement.</p>, <p></p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">TikTok influencers are covering themselves in their own feces to support <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOutTuesday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOutTuesday</a> <a href="https://t.co/mmJAfudemV">pic.twitter.com/mmJAfudemV</a></p>, <p><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>, <p></p>, <p>Then came the attacks on statues and other public monuments. A statue of Winston Churchill in central London was graffitied with the word “Racist.” Britain’s Cenotaph war memorial was desecrated, and a young Black woman attempted to burn the Union Jack that hung from it. The statue of an 18th-century philanthropist and slave trader, which had stood in Bristol since 1895, was dragged down by a mob and thrown in the dock. Other statues that “offended” the sensitivities of the mob were preemptively removed, likely never to be re-erected, to prevent their destruction, including one of Belgium’s King Leopold, which stood in Brussels.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>The streaming service HBO Max removed the American civil war epic <em>Gone With The Wind</em> (1939)—a film preserved by the Library of Congress as “culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant”<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="ffn4">4</a></sup>—after its romanticization of the South and depiction of African slaves was deemed unwatchable in the current climate. The chairman of Warner Media called the ban a “no brainer,” a curious choice of words.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="ffn5">5</a></sup> The BBC even removed from its streaming sites relatively recent comedies, made by liberal comedians only a decade ago, such as the light-hearted “Little Britain,” because “times have changed.”<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn6" id="ffn6">6</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>This wasn’t just mob rule and anarchy. On display was a religious intensity. And people were sucked into it. If the mob declared that you were not a “true believer,” you could lose your job, or perhaps even be subject to a police investigation. So, as more people exhibited their adherence to the Cult of George Floyd, an arms-race developed to indicate ever-greater fervor.</p>, <p></p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">We need to stop calling things like this “liberalism” or a “civic religion.” It’s a religion.

In April 2020, experts in the study of religion cautiously suggested that there might be some kind of religious revival in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis, though they focused on what might happen in churches.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn7" id="ffn7">7</a></sup> There are always religious revivals after or during wars, famines, and pandemics. Why would the Covid-19 be any different?</p>, <p> </p>, <p>In other words, we are witnessing another “Great Awakening.” But the religion of a significant portion of Western populations, and especially the young, is not Christianity. This new global religion of the 21st century is Multiculturalism. That said, Multiculturalism contains many elements of evangelicalism, both aesthetically and structurally, and perhaps could be viewed as Christianity’s latest mutation.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>In order to understand what has taken place, we need to make sense of what religion is; why “mortality salience” is relevant to it; and how, precisely, religious revivals occur. Once this is clear, we will see that Multiculturalism is not just an ideology, partisan politics, or passing fad; it must properly be understood as a religion itself.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>One of the key predictors of becoming religious is being confronted with your own mortality or that of your loved ones. No matter what an inveterate skeptic might say or write throughout his life, when told that his mother is in intensive care or his daughter has been in a car accident, there is a very strong possibility that, in private, he will beg God for help. “There are no atheists in foxholes,” as the saying goes. So-called “mortality salience” is an extreme example of the kind of psychological stress that appears to elevate religiousness. “Feelings of exclusion” seems to cause people to become more religious, too, as do periods of dramatic change, such as significant changes in government.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn8" id="ffn8">8</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>“Religion,” in the widely accepted sense of the word, involves all of the key components of an evolutionary adaptation. Religiousness is around 0.4 genetic; it is associated with physical and mental health partly at the genetic level;<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn9" id="ffn9">9</a></sup> it correlates with fertility; and specific parts of the brain are associated with it.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn10" id="ffn10">10</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>There are likely a number of non-exclusive reasons why religiousness evolved. One is that it promoted pro-social behavior. Those who believed in a god who told them to behave in a pro-social way were less likely to be cast out or killed by the pre-historic band and were, therefore, more likely to pass on their genes. A related possibility is that it reduced stress in the face of danger or as we become aware of our own mortality. Those who felt that their life had eternal meaning and that a god was constantly looking after them would be less likely to become depressed and anxious and would be more likely to pass on their genes.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn11" id="ffn11">11</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>Consistent with this, not only do people tend to become more religious at times of stress, they are more likely to have dramatic religious experiences, in which they do not merely vaguely feel that God is present but, as far as they are concerned, see Him and hear His reassuring voice.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn12" id="ffn12">12</a></sup> People who are high in neurotic personality traits are prone to depression and anxiety, these being manifestations of “mental instability.” Neuroticism seems to decrease considerably after one has undergone conversion and other religious experiences.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn13" id="ffn13">13</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>Intrinsic religiousness—genuinely believing in god—is negatively correlated with Neuroticism.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn14" id="ffn14">14</a></sup> We can see this in the average churchgoer of the past century, a man who conforms to the belief system of his community, intellectually believes in a higher power, but likely doesn’t take his religion overly seriously nor does he worship with particular emotional affect. On the other hand, extrinsic religiousness—outward conformity to religion—is positively associated with Neuroticism. We can think of the fanatic or obnoxious scold, someone who wears his faith on his sleeve, perhaps even so devoted that religion negatively affects his welfare.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Being a “religious seeker” is also associated with Neuroticism. This involves going through phases of mental instability that are alleviated by an unusual and often very extreme forms of religiosity, which are duly abandoned during periods of sound mental health.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn15" id="ffn15">15</a></sup> Overall, it’s reasonable to argue that religiousness would have been selected for, because it promoted mental health, with the result that mental health and religiosity have become genetically related, due to both being simultaneously selected over a lengthy period of time.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn16" id="ffn16">16</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>Religion also would have been “kin-selected.” You can pass on your genes indirectly by aiding your kin: your children share 50 percent of your genes, and more distant kin, such as nephews, share 25 percent. If a person were highly religious, it makes their kin more attractive, because of the associations between religiousness, pro-social behavior, and mental stability. This would help explain why some Islamic fundamentalists kill daughters who have dishonored the family. It is a way of signaling the family’s commitment to Islam and, thus, elevating kin selection.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn17" id="ffn17">17</a></sup> An ethnic group is, in the sense, an extended genetic kinship group and thus a means by which you can indirectly pass on your genes.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn18" id="ffn18">18</a></sup> It is has been found, using computer modeling, that groups that are highest in positive ethnocentrism (internal cooperation) and negative ethnocentrism (external hostility) tend to dominate others in the battle of group selection.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn19" id="ffn19">19</a></sup> There is evidence implying that religiousness is genetically associated with both kinds of ethnocentrism, because a part of the brain associated with ethnocentrism is also associated with religiousness.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn20" id="ffn20">20</a></sup> And the correlation between positive ethnocentrism and religiousness would make sense because a group would be more internally cooperate if it were high in pro-social traits and low in mental instability. But our key point is that religiousness has evolved, in part, as a means of coping with stress and mortality salience.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>The high female presence both in BLM protests and in churches is obvious to anyone who has ever attended either. And this shouldn’t be surprising. Women are more religious than men, across cultures, in terms of how likely they are to believe in God and engage in collective worship.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn21" id="ffn21">21</a></sup> In the United States, Catholics, Evangelical Protestants, Mainline Protestants, and Mormons are each 55 percent female. Some 70 percent of American women report an “absolute certainty” in their belief in a god, compared to 57 percent of men. American women are also much more likely to report that religion is important in their lives, and atheism is found twice as often among men than women (12 percent vs. 6 percent).<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn22" id="ffn22">22</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>This occurs because religion has been <em>sexually selected</em> for, too, as it is associated with being pro-social, rule-following (and thus not cuckolding your husband or abandoning your family and child), and with being part of a supportive group of co-religionists. These clear sex differences in the strength of religiousness will become significant later when we analyze the Black Lives Matter protests.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>There are a number of probable reasons for higher female religiousness, one of which is empathy. Females are higher than in empathetic behavior, which involves being interested in people’s feelings and being able to detect their feelings from external markers, such as facial expressions.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn23" id="ffn23">23</a></sup> There is evidence that people who are high in empathy transfer this ability over to the world itself, meaning that they perceive the presence of a “mind” or “higher power” simply from looking around the world. Accordingly, low empathy—that is, stereotypical autism—is associated with atheism.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn24" id="ffn24">24</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>Another reason may be adaptation to patriarchy. Females sexually select for male status because a high-status male is better able to invest in them and their offspring, meaning that both are more likely to survive.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn25" id="ffn25">25</a></sup> Until the Industrial Revolution, wealth and status strongly predicted completed fertility, and this is the case among pre-industrial peoples today. <sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn26" id="ffn26">26</a></sup> If males must invest resources in the female in order to obtain sexual intercourse, then they want to be certain that the offspring in which they are investing their resources are actually their own. The result is a system of patriarchy in which females are controlled by males such that male paternity anxiety can be reduced. This system of patriarchy will tend to be promoted by the society’s religion as divinely ordained, possibly because patriarchal societies reduce paternity anxiety, meaning that they, in turn, reduce inter-male conflict, thus causing males to be more internally cooperative. And, again, as computer models have shown, societies of internally cooperative people are more likely to triumph in warfare with competing societies.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn27" id="ffn27">27</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>This system of patriarchy, however, would mean that females would be strongly selected to be accepting of patriarchy and thus to be religious, as this is what the religion would promote.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn28" id="ffn28">28</a></sup> Consequently, there would be a religious “arms race” among females in order to obtain the highest-status males, especially in the kind of polygamous societies in which humans have lived for most of history, in which the highest status males monopolize the most desirable females. As such, we would expect females to be strongly prone to wishing to signal their virtue and, if religiosity were regarded as virtuous, to signal this. And they would be more convincingly able to signal it if they genuinely believed it.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>It is also clear to anyone that has ever attended a BLM protest that many of those involved—with their stereotypical unnatural colored hair and screams of righteous fury—are not mentally well. By contrast, females in churches appear sober and under control.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Why should traditional religiousness be associated with mental health? The answer lies in its evolutionary history. In understanding the evolution of religion, it is worth noting that it is a combination of a variety of traits, which would have been adaptive in pre-history.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>1. Agency Over-Detection.</strong> We have a cognitive bias towards detecting the presence of an agent behind events. Following the “Smoke Detector Principle,” it is adaptive to assume the worst and get it wrong—such as to assume that that noise over there was a wolf rather than just the wind. This helps to explain why we might see evidence of god in the world.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>2. Pattern Over-Detection.</strong> We are evolved to over-detect causation. This is adaptive because those who under-detected it would have put themselves in danger of being wiped out or not been able to analyze and understand the world around them.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>3. Follow the Leader.</strong> We are evolved to form <em>strongly-bonded groups</em> and <em>obey authority</em>. By working as a team with a leader, groups are more likely to survive in the battle of group selection.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn29" id="ffn29">29</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>Religions will vary in the extent of the prominence of each of these factors. This means that although religiousness is generally adaptive in an evolutionary sense of promoting individual and especially group fitness, it is quite possible for maladaptive forms of religiousness—which do not promote genetic fitness—to manifest. Some devotees might be, for example, too extreme in their obedience to the leader or in their pattern over-detection, such that adhering to such a religion is harmful for its followers. An obvious example of this would be suicide cults—such as the notorious Jonestown—in which devotees are so inclined to follow their leader and so inclined to over-detect patterns that they accept a mentally ill man’s paranoid worldview and kill themselves, completely destroying their genetic interests.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn30" id="ffn30">30</a></sup> Membership of such groups is associated with other maladaptive traits—such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder—whereas traditional religiousness is genetically associated with mental health.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>The relationship between religiousness and sound mental health makes sense if we delve a little deeper into how religiousness has been selected for over time. This will also be highly relevant, later, to understanding the nature of the Black Lives Matter movement. As I have discussed in my study “The Mutant Says in His Heart, ‘There is No God,’”<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn31" id="ffn31">31</a></sup> we were under conditions of harsh Darwinian selection until the breakthroughs of the Industrial Revolution, which began in around 1800. The resulting improved public health and living conditions meant that child mortality has fallen from around 50 percent in 1800 to 1 percent today.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn32" id="ffn32">32</a></sup> High child mortality ensured that the surviving population was very strongly adapted to its ecology. Babies with mutations that made them unfit—such as those leading to a poor immune system—were purged from the population every generation, meaning that it overall had a very low “mutational load.” Under these brutal conditions, traditional religion—based around the collective worship of a moral god—was adaptive, meaning that it came to be selected for in tandem with other adaptive traits, which thus became genetically connected.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>With the break-down of harsh Darwinian selection, we would expect the population to display increasing evidence of mutational load. This would be observed in secular increases in the prevalence of partly genetic medical conditions.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn33" id="ffn33">33</a></sup> We would also expect the development of all kinds of deviations from this delicately balanced Darwinian religious norm—deviations that would be maladaptive in terms of group and individual selection and that would be attractive to people with maladaptive traits, such as mental illness. Religious suicide cults, such as Jonestown and Waco, would exemplify this process. These religious deviants would have high mutational loads and likely be people who would not have survived childhood under harsh Darwinian conditions.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>How do we know that such people would not have survived? In that the brain is 84 percent of the genome, it is an enormous target for mutation, meaning that those who have physical mutations can be expected to have mental mutations as well, which would direct them towards deviations from the most adaptive form of religiousness. Consistent with this, it has been found that, in modern samples, collective worship of a moral god is genetically associated with physical and mental health and is negatively associated with other markers of high mutational load, including autism, physical asymmetry, and left-handedness. These are associated with atheism or religious deviations, such as paranormal belief. The inability to develop a symmetrical phenotype implies a poor immune system, because a person with a poor immune system would have to use disproportionately more of his bio-energetic resources to fight off pathogens, meaning insufficient resources left over to ensure symmetry. Left-handedness is an accepted marker of “developmental instability.” If the brain develops symmetrically, people will tend to be right-handed. Failure to do so implies mutational load and, thus, left-handedness is associated with many examples of poor physical and mental health.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn34" id="ffn34">34</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>So, with the nature of “religion” and its connection to mortality salience understood, let us now turn to making sense of “religious revivals.”</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>Religious revivals appear to occur when the kind of situation that would lead to a period of religiousness in an individual—such as stress and mortality salience—are experienced relatively suddenly by a substantial portion of a society. There will be variation in the nature of the revival, depending on the kind of people who are impacted. But, in general, dramatic change and a period of difficulty can be expected to lead to a religious revival of some kind. These can be charted throughout history and, interestingly, there is often a time lag separating the period of stress from the revival itself.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Christian evangelists are constantly attempting to create revivals, traveling to different communities and preaching their message of conversion and redemption. However, they only seem to be able to create mass revivals during, or just after, periods of significant distress.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>An examination of British revivals during the 20th century is consistent with this pattern. The first major revival of the twentieth century took place in Wales between 1904 and 1905. At the time, South Wales was ravaged by industrial unrest and unemployment in a society in which there was no welfare state. Accordingly, Welsh workers, many of whom were already heavily influenced by Methodism and were facing serious hardship and the realistic possibility of destitution.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn35" id="ffn35">35</a></sup> Interesting, there was no religious revival during World War I in the UK, nor during the Spanish Flu pandemic that immediately followed it<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn36" id="ffn36">36</a></sup>. There were, however, various revivals during the 1920s. The lack of communications at the time meant that it was more difficult than in the 1950s for these to become national phenomena. A major revival in East Anglia in 1921 focused around socioeconomically deprived fishing communities, which were under considerable distress even compared to ordinary people recovering from the Great War. The following year, there were revivals in other parts of the country, most notably in fishing communities in northeast Scotland.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn37" id="ffn37">37</a></sup> There was no major revival in Britain in the 1930s, other than in the deeply conservative Hebridean islands off the north west of Scotland in 1939. This year was a time of elevated distress due to very real possibility that Britain might go to war again.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn38" id="ffn38">38</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>There was no major revival in the UK during World War II itself. The next Christian revival, and a concomitant reassertion of conservative attitudes, came after the War, and especially in the 1950s. There was a revival in the Hebrides in 1949, in which large numbers of people, who had not previously been especially devout, underwent religious experiences and became more involved in their church and in which those who were already religious became more fervent. According to revival leader the Rev. Duncan Campbell (1898-1972), in late 1949, in the village of Barvas on the Island of Lewis, he conducted a night-time meeting at which:</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>At 5 AM that morning, 14 buses full of people arrived from all parts of the island and even from the island of Harris. People at these meetings fell into trances, fainted, swayed and collapsed to the floor.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn39" id="ffn39">39</a></sup> Campbell felt that he had been inspired by the Holy Spirit to go and revive the Outer Hebrides and, given the stressful conditions of the time, people were extremely receptive to religious-fervor in a ways that they otherwise wouldn’t have been.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn40" id="ffn40">40</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>Wartime rationing did not cease until 1954, so it could be argued that it was only at this point that “normal life” finally reasserted itself.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn41" id="ffn41">41</a></sup> In an era of mass-communication, a spark was needed to set off a nationwide revival, and this came in the form of American pastor Billy Graham (1918-2018), as witnessed in his British rallies, which took place between 1954 and 1955. The postwar religious fervor was such that it has been estimated that roughly 21 percent of the London population attended a Billy Graham rally, while up 73 percent of the Glasgow population did so.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn42" id="ffn42">42</a></sup> In 1955, 100,000 people packed a Glasgow stadium to attend a single service conducted by Billy Graham.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn43" id="ffn43">43</a></sup> I am not aware that the relationship has been quantitatively tested, but, as a rule of British Modern History, religious revivals seem to manifest in areas of elevated mortality salience as a consequence of impoverishment or, directly, famine and other highly stressful phenomena.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>What was happening, in terms of individual and mass-psychology, during these revivals? As we have discussed, quotidian, stable religiousness—in which you are religious all the time—is correlated with sound mental health. Even religious people who are mentally healthy, however, go through periods of stress and mortality salience in which they may become more religious. They may even undergo forms of what is known as a “religious experience.”</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Religious experiences are profound psychological experiences in which a person may be overwhelmed by a feeling of God’s love and even hear God’s voice or believe to have seen Him. In making sense of these kinds of experiences, American neuroscientist Andrew Newberg and colleagues argue that the mind has two effective systems, calming and arousal. When either of these systems is pushed to their extremes, through meditation or hyper-arousal—both of which can be achieved via religious services—they argue that it is dangerous for the body. Accordingly, the other system hits in, leading to alternative states of consciousness and intense psychological experiences.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn44" id="ffn44">44</a></sup> British biologist Richard Dawkins has suggested that they may be provoked by the way in which stress makes us highly instinctive, and thus prone to religious belief anyway. Dawkins also argues that we are also evolved to over-detect agency: as mentioned above, if we mistake a distant rock for a wolf, we have lost nothing, but if we make the opposite mistake, we may be killed. Accordingly, at times of very intense stress, we are much more likely to mistake some unidentified sound as the voice of God and, at the same time, find that our calming system would hit in. This would lead to an intense religious experience combined with feelings of relief and joy.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn45" id="ffn45">45</a></sup> Undergoing mild religious experiences—known as “spiritual” experiences—is about 0.3 heritable. Undergoing intense religious experiences is approximately 0.66 heritable.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn46" id="ffn46">46</a></sup> This high heritability might imply that the ability to undergo a religious experience is extremely beneficial, in evolutionary terms, because it combats stress and, due to its profound nature, keeps you low in negative feelings for a substantial period of time afterwards.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>However, we must distinguish between the “religious experience” and the “conversion experience”—and also between being “religious,” being “hyper-religious,” and going through a phase of being intensely religious. American psychologist William James (1842-1910) distinguished between the religion of the “sick soul” and that of “healthy mindedness.” The religion of healthy mindedness is characterized by relatively mild religious experiences. The religion of the “sick soul,” however, is marked by a dramatic conversion experiences, which occur at times of intense stress.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn47" id="ffn47">47</a></sup> Those who lead religious revivals—people such as Billy Graham—can be regarded as constantly “hyper-religious.” As already noted, this is associated with either schizophrenia or with being a severely depressive personality. Psychological studies of those who lead religious revivals have found that most of them display evidence of these pathological traits. They require, for example, the absolute structure and order which fanatical religiousness provides in order to allay their anxiety and frequently undergo intense religious experiences.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn48" id="ffn48">48</a></sup> Such is the nature of revival “leaders.” It may be beneficial for a healthy society to be able to maintain a very small percentage of such lunatics, precisely because they are able to inspire fervent religiosity in other people and religiosity is traditionally a means of promoting ethnocentrism. In this regard, it has been noted that tribal shamans tend to the same kinds of psychological characteristics as modern-day charismatic leaders.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn49" id="ffn49">49</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>But what about the followers, and those who become followers during a revival? What is their psychology? Religious revivals are characterized by the “conversion” type of religious experience, in which a person undergoes a kind of psychological breakdown and, to some extent, adopts a new identity, for example as a “Christian” or as “<em>real</em> Christian” in a way that they somehow were not prior to the revival.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn50" id="ffn50">50</a></sup> They, consequently, go through a transient phrase of hyper-religiosity. Transient hyper-religiosity is associated with high Neuroticism,<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn51" id="ffn51">51</a></sup> while bipolar disorder and bouts of depression also predict periods of extreme religious fervor, as does schizophrenia.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn52" id="ffn52">52</a></sup> Schizophrenia, and its milder forms, is also elevated at times of stress, just as is anxiety.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn53" id="ffn53">53</a></sup> There is a range of severity to schizophrenia-type conditions. Mild symptoms are summarized as “schizoid personality.” This is characterized by <em>anhedonia</em> (the inability to experience joy) and apathy. More severe is “schizotypal personality,” where the schizoid symptoms are accompanied by social anxiety, paranoid ideation, unconventional or paranoid beliefs, and, sometimes, psychosis. Diagnosable schizophrenia is a particularly severe manifestation of these characteristics.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn54" id="ffn54">54</a></sup> Having undergone a conversion experience has been found to be associated with having been, prior to that experience, high in anxiety and other Neuroticism traits.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn55" id="ffn55">55</a></sup> When people suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress, which is associated with high Neuroticism, they can develop a very specific kind of religiosity known as “spiritual struggle” or “negative religious coping.” Those who undergo this believe that God is punishing them for their sins, plead for God to intervene in the world, and project hostility towards out-group members. “Positive religious coping” can cross over with this, insomuch as it involves conversion, but this also involves the belief that God has forgiven you and that you are purified of your sins.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn56" id="ffn56">56</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>So, people who are high in Neuroticism—and even under the harsh Darwinian conditions prevalent until 1800, there would have been population variance in this trait—are more likely to become part of religious revivals. They will feel stress more acutely and will, accordingly, be more likely to become extremely religious in the aftermath of periods of intense societal distress. Females score higher than males in Neuroticism. For this reason alone, we would predict that females would play a noticeable part in religious revivals.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn57" id="ffn57">57</a></sup> Consistent with this, studies of religious revivals in the U.S. have found that “white and black women were among the most visible participants at religious revivals, where converts wept, wailed, writhed, and fainted as they received God’s grace.”<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn58" id="ffn58">58</a></sup> Neuroticism tends to decrease with age in males. But in females, Neuroticism decreases with age until adolescence and at that point, it increases, possibly due to the adaptive need to worry about one’s children. This can be seen most obviously among university students, where females in particular tend to suffer mental health problems of various kinds that they will often have recovered from by the time they are in their mid-20s.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn59" id="ffn59">59</a></sup> Neuroticism, in women, begins to decline in early adulthood.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn60" id="ffn60">60</a></sup> For this reason, as well as due to their higher general religiousness, we would expect females in their mid-teens to mid-20s to be attracted to religious revivals. In line with this prediction, there is detailed data on those who “came forward” to receive God’s forgiveness during Billy Graham’s British rallies. In London, 65 percent were female and 50 percent were under the age of 19. In Glasgow, 71 percent were women and 73 percent were under the age of 30.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn61" id="ffn61">61</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>Even those who are not sufficiently Neurotic to undergo religious experiences can be expected to be influenced by a religious revival if it appears to be sufficiently popular. Neuroticism predicts extrinsic religiousness, that is, religious outward conformity.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn62" id="ffn62">62</a></sup> People who are high in Neuroticism will fear being judged negatively or even being ostracized for failure to conform, meaning that they may fake religious fervor even if they don’t actually feel it. This means that religious revivals that become particularly prominent can envelop people who are far lower in Neuroticism than those who are, as they see it, “slain by the Holy Spirit.” Accordingly, popular revivals can generate a kind of group hysteria and thus appear far more popular than they really are. This is obvious when we consider how so many celebrities felt compelled to jump on the bandwagon of Black Lives Matter.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>So, with the nature of “religion” and “religious revivals” clear in our minds, we can now explore the “religious” nature of the Black Lives Matter protests. There are obvious parallels between 20th-century religious revivals—such as that that spear-headed by Billy Graham—and the Black Lives Matter revival. The leaders of the movement are extreme “liberals”—with this being clearly associated with mental instability, where conservatism and traditional religiosity are correlated with mental stability.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn63" id="ffn63">63</a></sup> The “revival” has taken place in the wake of a period of elevated mortality salience; in other words, it is a response to stress. Those who are drawn into it are politically liberal themselves, with this being associated with mental instability.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn64" id="ffn64">64</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>In many respects, Multiculturalism can be argued to be a secular “replacement religion” for Christianity—and perhaps even a kind of Christian sect. The same argument has been made with regard to Marxism and even some kinds of Romantic Nationalism.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>Traditional Christianity is based around a series of dogmas that you must accept in order to be regarded as a Christian and achieve salvation. These dogmas are sometimes logically incoherent—such as the Trinity—or require the acceptance of truth-claims that cannot be proved or are, on any reasonable basis, extraordinarily improbable. However, you signal your intellectual submission to the religious community by accepting these. This can be regarded as their purpose; they are tests of loyalty. In much the same way, Multiculturalism requires that you accept dogmas that are empirically inaccurate or patently nonsensical, such as that there are no race differences in intelligence or that everyone is “equal.”</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>Christianity also tends towards idolizing the “marginalized.” It preaches that “the last shall be first” and encourages its followers to empower those who are supposedly marginalized, and humble themselves, embracing a kind of sacred poverty. Similarly, Marxism idolizes the dispossessed in the form of the “worker”; Romantic nationalism worships the “peasant”; and Multiculturalism, as espoused by Whites, idolizes non-Whites, and the more different they are—culturally and genetically—from Whites, the more they are worthy of reverence. There is evidence that humans—being evolved to tightly structured groups—have two fundamental instincts: one towards climbing the social hierarchy and the other towards equality, as groups that are relatively equal tend to avoid collapsing into discord.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn65" id="ffn65">65</a></sup> Thus, religions that preach “equality” can be highly psychologically attractive, especially to those who are not close to the top of the hierarchy or who fear they will not be able to get there. This is consistent with evidence that males who are physically strong—and thus who would have been more likely to ascend the prehistoric hierarchy via winning fights and being sexually selected for—are more likely to hold conservative views that specifically favor hierarchy and inequality.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn66" id="ffn66">66</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>The third key point that Multiculturalism has in common with Christianity, though not with pagan religions such as Hinduism, is the salience of “guilt.” In general, “guilt” and “shame” both function to make people “know their place,” and thus conform and behave in pro-social, cooperative ways. Accordingly, a group that adopts a religion imbued with these feelings to an optimum degree would be likely to out-compete other groups.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Christianity is a religion to which “guilt” is extremely important—“central to the biblical message” as one theologian has put it.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn67" id="ffn67">67</a></sup> According to Christian dogmas, humanity is “Fallen” as a consequence of its “Original Sin.” In other words, God is perfect and all-benevolent, whereas humanity is inherently sinful and bad, living in a sinful, Fallen world. Indeed, it was cast down into this world from Paradise as a punishment for its wickedness. The only way humanity can gain salvation and forgiveness is to admit how sinful it is and humbly worship God and follow the commands of His Church. Worldly success is, in a sense, something for which you should feel guilty—unless you are certain that God has blessed you with this success—because it implies that you are insufficiently humble; you are failing to sufficiently repent for your wickedness.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>In much the same fashion, the Church of Multiculturalism tells its adherents that they are burdened by the Original Sin of Whiteness. White people are presumed to have treated people of other races in abominable ways, with images of slavery, the Holocaust, Jim Crow, and the like acting as symbols of their primal deeds. Whites must repent for their Original Sin by empowering those who are not White, such that racial “Equality” is attained. In the same way that wealthy people in Christian societies are “privileged” and must engage in charitable works to assuage their “guilt,” White people have the “privilege” of being “White”—not only being wealthy but enjoying that wealth at the expense of non-Whites, whom their ancestors brutalized, enslaved, or murdered. “Privilege” is the source of “guilt,” which must be assuaged through acts of humility and penance, potentially including not producing White children and adopting non-Whites instead.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Shame, though less obvious, is also germane to Christianity and its replacement religions. Those who refused to conform to Christianity could be “shamed” as devil-worshippers who might bring God’s anger on the community, and shunned accordingly. Those who do not “take the knee” for George Floyd or who remain silent, instead of publicly stating their support for Black Lives Matter, can be shamed as possible “racists;” with this term of abuse implying that you are not an adherent to the religious community. You are “Other.” This is because membership of the community is based around adherence to dogmas, not around blood-bonds, as is the case with pagan religions and with many forms of nationalism.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn68" id="ffn68">68</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>The key difference between the Church of Multiculturalism and Christianity is that there is no god—no non-physical existence. Moreover, Black Lives Matter represents an extremely “spiteful” form of religiosity, in the sense that there doesn’t appear to be any “forgiveness.” In Billy Graham rallies, you could “step forward” and be forgiven for your sins. In Black Lives Matter rallies, it doesn’t matter how many times you “take the knee,” there can be no forgiveness for your sin of being White. You must simply learn to live with the guilt, slightly assuaging it ever so often by campaigning to empower non-Whites.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>As previously discussed, we can conceive of two distinct kinds of religion: those which are selected for under centuries of Darwinian conditions—that tend to involve the collective worship of a moral god—and those which deviate from this norm. Due to the way in which mental health and religiousness were co-selected under Darwinian conditions as we have explored, this “traditional religiosity” is now positively associated with mental health, while deviations from it—such as New Age affectations or belief in the paranormal—are associated with anxiety and depression, either on-going or periodic. People who are high in mental instability can be expected to become highly religious in the wake of a crisis and being low in traditional religiosity as well as fervently left-wing correlates with being high in mental instability</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Accordingly, we would expect such people—self-identified “liberals”—to become extremely religious (in terms of their religious deviation) in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, and this is what we appear to be seeing. In previous situations of gravity, the overwhelming majority of the British population was Christian and believed, to varying degrees, in its doctrines. This would have meant that the relationship between being a traditional Christian and mental stability would have been much weaker than is now the case. It also meant that the revivals were Christian in nature, because this was the religious belief even of the kind of mentally unstable people who tend to undergo intense religious experiences. As already noted, a specific form of religiosity has been found to manifest among mentally unstable people suffering from high levels of stress—“Spiritual Struggle.” Those who felt the Holy Spirit during this revival would be, in general, relatively high in Neuroticism, something that would be soothed, temporarily, by their religious experience. Usually, their Christian zeal would be temporary. It would no longer be psychologically required once the period of stress was over and recovered from, by which time the factor that was elevating their anxiety to intolerable levels would have dissipated.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>In 2020, especially for younger people, their religion is Multiculturalism and <em>not</em> Christianity. Christianity is now the religion of a shrinking minority. Consequently, we would expect some variant on the kind of revival outlined above to occur in the wake of Covid-19, especially among such people. Its leaders, as with Christian revivals, would be mentally unstable people. However, many of the “followers,” caught up in the revival, would be prone to mental instability and would be going through a particularly acute phase of anxiety. As with a Christian revival, these feelings would be alleviated by the collective experience—in this instance of “Black Lives Matter”—in which they would feel a sense of certainty that they were morally superior; that they were better than most (“racist”) people; and that they were part of creating a paradise on Earth. Once the anxiety-reducing feelings this induced wore off, such people would no longer be subject to acute mortality salience and then they would return to being much less fervent believers in the Church of Multiculturalism.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>We would expect any such revival to be more pronounced among Multiculturalists than among Christians. Social Justice Warriors are irreligious and liberal, both of which correlate with mental instability. “Christians” are conservative and religious, both associated with mental stability. Accordingly, in a world in which remnant Christianity is associated with sound mindedness, a Multiculturalist revival in the wake of a pandemic becomes far more probable than a Christian one—though there still may be a Christian one of some kind in the near future. We would expect this Multiculturalist revival to be elevated among young people—because people go through a period of relatively high mental instability when they are young adults—and, in particular, among young females, because females are more religious than males and they are more prone to depression and anxiety. Multiculturalism is the “new religion”—the “new morality”—and thus females would be evolved to want to signal the extent of their adherence to it, being ultimately psychologically adapted to polygamous societies in which they must compete for the highest status males by strongly signaling their religiosity and sexual faithfulness.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn69" id="ffn69">69</a></sup> Females are also evolved to a patriarchal society in which decisions tend to be made for them by their fathers and husbands. With the breakdown of patriarchy, it has been argued that we would expect females—especially young females—to make particularly maladaptive decisions.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn70" id="ffn70">70</a></sup> These would include strongly aligning with a religion that seeks to destroy their ethnic group and effectively encouragers them to be childless.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>It should be noted that, in relatively religious societies, females tend to be more politically conservative than males, seemingly because females are more religious and the religion promotes “traditional” values as the will of God. However, when the influence of traditional religiousness breaks down, the female propensity towards higher empathy—and thus leftism and anti-traditionalism—begins to manifest. In 1992, in Britain, women born in the 1920s were more conservative than men of the same age. However, women born in the 1960s were <em>less</em> conservative than males of the same age.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn71" id="ffn71">71</a></sup> These younger women, no longer as influenced by traditional religious ideas, tend to promote leftist ones—including altruism towards competing ethnic groups—with a kind of religious zeal. One commentator astutely termed them “The New Church Ladies,” evoking the subterranean religious quality to so much of contemporary female discourse.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn72" id="ffn72">72</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>Traditional religiousness took the female propensity to strongly believe in God and engage in religious worship and focused this into an adaptive form of religiosity in which God promoted group-selected values. With the breakdown of this religion, we are left with females tending to be religiously fervent and high in generalized empathy and thus attracted to Multiculturalism and leftism. Females are also higher than males in Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism, and, thus in social conformity.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn73" id="ffn73">73</a></sup> So, for this reason as well, we would expect them to be more heavily involved in the New Church into which younger females have been inculcated.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>It has been observed that highly educated young people—those with post-graduate degrees—are significantly over-represented among Black Lives Matter activists.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn74" id="ffn74">74</a></sup> One possible explanation for this—beyond the fact that university Humanities and Social Science departments are increasingly indoctrination factories for leftist ideas<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn75" id="ffn75">75</a></sup>—is that there is a positive relationship between Neuroticism and academic success at university, especially when this is combined with high Conscientiousness (impulse control and rule-following).<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn76" id="ffn76">76</a></sup> This is possibly because anxiety acts as a motivator towards diligence or because Neuroticism means you desire greater certainty about the nature of the world and believe you can attain this through higher education. In that Neuroticism predicts extrinsic religiousness<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn77" id="ffn77">77</a></sup>—that is, outward religious conformity—we would expect non-SJWs who were relatively high in these traits to be drawn into this dominant, public revival due to their fear of not conforming, leading them to compete to strongly outwardly conform.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>The other difference between the British religious awakenings in the 20th century and Black Lives Matter is the anarchy involved: BLM activists flagrantly breaking the law, engaging in dangerous behavior, rioting, inciting perpetual disorder (“No Justice, No Peace”), and engaging in iconoclasm by toppling statues and desecrating memorials. In this sense, a clearer comparison can be found in the Peasants War that took place in German-speaking states in the 1520s, in the early days of the Reformation. There are multiple reasons why the Reformation began when it did, but one of them was a period of elevated mortality salience. There had been severe famine in Germany between 1515 and 1520.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn78" id="ffn78">78</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>Reports indicate that violent Protestant mobs would strip Catholic Churches of their valuables and destroy their idols. As with Black Lives Matter, educated people were heavily over-represented among early Protestant iconoclasts—they were mainly the so-called “middling sort.”<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn79" id="ffn79">79</a></sup> The Protestant leaders would oppose iconoclasm, publicly stating that idols should only be removed with permission from the proper authorities. But, as has occurred in Britain in 2020, the Swiss authorities preemptively removed icons as a way of halting public disorder and also as way of appeasing Protestant leaders. In June 1524, all Zurich churches were closed in order to prevent a maelstrom.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn80" id="ffn80">80</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>In other words, Black Lives Matter is a particularly pronounced religious revival. In the 1520s, this occurred, in part, due to particularly difficult conditions. In 2020, it may be that the cause was moderately difficult conditions plus a growing percentage of young people who, partly for genetic reasons underpinned by increasing mutational load, increasingly suffer from depression and anxiety and, therefore, cannot psychologically cope with what would have been historically regarded as quite normal levels of mortality salience. Contemporary young people are increasingly in a situation of “evolutionary mismatch” where—under the influence of modern, anti-traditional ideologies, over-parenting, and education— they are decreasingly socialized as children in the manner that was the norm under harsh Darwinian conditions. This has been shown to lead to severe behavioral problems in non-human animals,<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn81" id="ffn81">81</a></sup> and we will explore this issue in more detail below.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Furthermore, far superior communications—social media and instantaneous reactions to events around the world—mean that what may otherwise have been isolated patches of revivalism have been globalized, impacting much larger numbers of people. And there may also be an extent to which these riots are in the interests of some powerful individuals, who are themselves fervent adherents to Multiculturalism or who desire a subservient population that will not challenge them. If the population is depressed and demoralized, this subservience is clearly better accomplished. Accordingly, the riots—which could be crushed if so desired—are permitted to run their course. It is as if ordinary people are being told: “Look what we can allow to happen to you if you elect the wrong people or vote the wrong way in a referendum.” Afraid of offending the righteous mob—and their high-level sympathizers—even leaders who oppose leftist disorder dare not act decisively. Again, comparisons to the iconoclasm of the early English Reformation leap to mind. Iconoclasts were permitted to “get away with it” during the periods when the Protestant faction, most notably led by Thomas Cromwell (c.1485-1540), wielded the most influence at Court.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn82" id="ffn82">82</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>All of this leads us to a final question. How have we reached a situation where so many people—including many in positions of power—wish to destroy their own extended kinship group?</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>Christianity, even the zealous kind of the Reformation, was an adaptive form of religiosity. Thus, a key part of it is “forgiveness”—after publicly confessing your sins and wavering of faith. With the breakdown of Darwinian selection, we see an increasing deviation from this religious evolutionary norm, including religions that are maladaptive, because they are ultimately nihilistic and lack doctrines that allow a person’s highly negative feelings during times of stress to be fully expunged. This is what we see with Black Lives Matter—the ultimate logic of which is that Whites should simply feel perpetual shame throughout their lives with no hope of it being alleviated, other than in a very mild and brief way via “taking the knee.”</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Young people have been inculcated with this maladaptive religion due, in part, to the breakdown of traditional Christianity, which, like all religions that survived under harsh Darwinian conditions, tended to take behavior that was adaptive in terms of group selection and turn this into the will of God. As discussed above, as child mortality collapsed, we had more and more people who would not have survived under harsher conditions—due to their high mutational load—who had mutations of the mind that caused to hold beliefs that would be highly maladaptive if held by even a small percentage of the group—anti-natalism being only the most obvious. Due to our being a highly eusocial species—that is, interacting in a “hive mind”—we are heavily influenced by those around us. In this way, it has been found that depression can spread like a contagion. If you are around a person who is depressed then you are more likely to become depressed yourself, a condition which is negatively associated with fertility.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn83" id="ffn83">83</a></sup> As a result, these mutants— <em>spiteful</em> mutants<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn84" id="ffn84">84</a></sup>—helped to spread their maladaptive ways of thinking even to non-mutants, gradually undermining adaptive institutions, such as traditional churches, and replacing them with their Church of Multiculturalism, a church which is now clearly adhered to even by the leadership of the Church of England.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn85" id="ffn85">85</a></sup> Having taken over the state’s organs of power, such as the education system and the media, they could then inculcate young people into the New Church, alter the evolutionarily adaptive methods of socialization traditionally imposed on them, and push them—and with them, the entire super-organism—to think and behave increasingly contra to their genetic interests.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>This became possible when a “tipping point” is reached, whereby about 25 percent of the population advocated anti-traditional ideas. Experiments have shown that when this happens, people perceive the new worldview as the way forward and begin to abandon the old one <em>en masse</em>.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn86" id="ffn86">86</a></sup> With our evolution to obedience and following the leader and the mob, this can sometimes result in a misfiring of our adaptations such that we start to engage in behavior which is not in our evolutionary interests. This is particularly likely to be the case if we are subject to “evolutionary mismatch;” if we are placed in an ecology to which we are not evolved. We are evolved to a pre-industrial ecology, so we can expect to find ourselves increasingly maladapted as the ecology increasingly deviates from this. We will engage in behavior which would have been adaptive under previous conditions – such as following the crowd – but this will be decreasingly adaptive as the crowd is increasingly evolutionarily mismatched, mutated and influenced by spiteful mutants.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>In 1954, this tipping point had not yet been reached in Britain. People forced themselves, for fear of ostracism, through so-called “effortful control,”<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn87" id="ffn87">87</a></sup> to believe in traditional Christianity, meaning that the revival was Christian and adaptive in nature. Around 1970, the tipping point was reached. This is demonstrated by the fact that evidence of mutational load – in the form of autism, which is associated with paternal age – did not predict atheism in the 1950s, but by the 1970s it did predict atheism. By the 1970s, in the U.S., having an older father predicted atheism in a way that had not previously been the case. This is because Christianity was so strong during the earlier period that autistics, who tend not to be religious as we have already noted, forced themselves to conform to the dominant religiosity. By the latter period, the tipping point had been reached, so they no longer needed to conform.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn88" id="ffn88">88</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>The Church of Multiculturalism, and its Black Lives Matter conversion rallies, is a Church with “spiteful mutants” as its priestly class. Under harsh Darwinian conditions, only those with adaptive cognitive biases survived childhood, because maladaptive cognitive biases were under-pinned by mutation, and those with high mutational load would likely perish before reaching adulthood. With the extreme relaxation of these conditions, these “spiteful mutants” walk among us in significant numbers. These are people who are programmed to behave in a way that is highly maladaptive in evolutionary terms—which results in the destruction of group and even individual fitness—and to persuade others to do likewise. All of the doctrines they advocate involve, if accepted, essentially being a “failure as an organism”:</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>The toppling of “racist” statues by the Black Lives Matter mob can be perceived as tearing down the “old gods,” those whom European people have venerated as heroes. These statues have traditionally been erected to honor highly group-selected people who have promoted the genetic interests of Europeans by expanding their territory and leading their ethnic group to victory over rivals. In a sense, the statues are sacred, they are idols; objects of worship. To tear them down is a way of asserting that the religion that they represented no longer has any power, is no longer sacred, simply because the idols that embody it can successfully humiliated.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>In 1520, Spanish explorer Hernan Cortes (1485-1547) destroyed every Aztec idol that he could and desecrated the temples. He noticed that it left the Aztecs demoralized and less able to put up a fight.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn89" id="ffn89">89</a></sup> So, this leaves the worshipers in a state of confusion in which the previously certain, uniquely real system by which they made sense of the world—and in which they played an integral and positive part—is an under assault. They feel confused because they have got used to this system, and the comforting presence of these statues, and they feel demoralized and anxious. Any significant change can cause this by virtue of elevating anxiety about the unknown.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn90" id="ffn90">90</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>This, alongside the symbolism of the system that gives their life meaning being attacked, leads them to feel depressed and looking for new certainties. But what if the certainties offered are nihilistic and tell you that you are inherently evil and should debase and even destroy yourself, never able to be forgiven for your and your ancestors’ sins? This is the ultimate message of the Death Cult that is the Church of Multiculturalism. It is, therefore, no coincidence that it attracts the same psychological types who are attracted to literal suicide cults. Indeed, a Black Lives Matter Suicide Cult, in which young White women kill themselves to repent for their racist sins, would not be beyond the realms of possibility.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>The Uncharted video game franchise is a flagship of the Playstation brand, having sold more than 41.7 million copies.

They’re among the most impressive, lavishly produced, movie-like video games ever made. The player’s avatar is a globetrotting treasure hunter clearly inspired by Indiana Jones. Just as <em>Indiana Jones</em> was co-created by Steven Spielberg, <em>Uncharted</em> was co-created by the Jewish Neil Druckmann, and these aren’t the only things they share in common.</p>, <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Druckmann">Druckmann</a> is an Israeli whose family immigrated to America when he was eleven-years-old. In college he co-created his first video game, an 8-bit demo called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_H8HlO5mVE"><em>Dikki Painguin in: TKO for the Third Reich</em></a> (which appears to be a hack of Act 2, stage 1 of <a href="https://youtu.be/Fq3nL57zLSc?t=289"><em>Ninja Gaiden 2</em></a>). It stars a cartoon penguin fighting Germans in World War Two. Suffice to say, Druckmann’s Jewish identity has informed his game design from the very beginning.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3307">Druckmann’s first video game starred a cartoon penguin fighting the German National Socialists.</p>, <p>Druckmann joined <a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/">Naughty Dog</a> – the Sony-owned subsidiary that created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Bandicoot_(video_game)"><em>Crash Bandicoot</em></a> games – in 2004 after meeting its co-founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Rubin">Jason Rubin</a> at an industry conference. Rubin is also Jewish, so perhaps that played a part in his hiring.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Rubin has since left the company and Druckmann is now vice president. Yet despite being born in Israel and repeatedly referencing the German National Socialists in his video games, Druckmann has attempted to downplay his ethnicity.</p>, <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.scpr.org/programs/the-frame/2016/07/13/50456/a-peek-into-naughty-dog-game-creator-neil-druckman/"><em>The Frame</em></a> Druckmann said, “I see myself as a pretty progressive person and yet (as a writer) my default (character) is a white, straight, christian [<em>sic</em>] male. That’s interesting because I’m Jewish and yet that’s the norm for me right now.”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> He’s right, that <em>is</em> interesting considering he surreptitiously casts Jews in leading roles! For example, the protagonist in Druckmann’s <em>The Last of Us</em> is evidently Jewish. This detail is never explicitly emphasized in the games’ surface narrative, but was confirmed in an official holiday illustration.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3310">An official holiday greetings card published on Naughty Dog’s official Twitter account shows The Last of Us’ Joel in a Hannukah sweater.</p>, <p class="has-background has-accent-background-color">Like his peers in Hollywood and <a href="https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2018/02/17/marketing-miscegenation/">advertising</a>, Druckmann has been keen to insert a radical left wing agenda in his stories. He inexplicably decided that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us:_Left_Behind">an interracial lesbian romance between teenagers</a> would appeal to his largely “White, straight, Christian male” audience, and doubled down with <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> (just released this month). In addition to promoting homosexuality, the company has hired a <a href="https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Ian_Alexander">transsexual</a> actor and made his/her character a transsexual, and one of the antagonists has been made more muscular since she was originally revealed, in order to be more “trans friendly.” In the aforementioned interview with <em>The Frame</em>, Druckmann confirmed that his games will feature fewer heterosexual White men moving forward:</p>, <p>“When you make a game, you have these different pillars that you’re trying to balance. It’s graphics, it’s gameplay, it’s story and you’re trying not to let any one pillar overwhelm the other. . . Recently, I realized that there’s this other pillar of diversity. That’s just as important as any one of these other pillars. I’ve kind of empowered <a href="https://wonderwomentech.com/speaker/emilia-schatz/">people on the team</a> that have made this their top priority. . . Can this be a person of color? Can this be a woman?”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>, <p>Incredibly, the above examples merely scratch the surface of the subversiveness of Druckmann’s games. What follows is an analysis of the four main <em>Uncharted</em> games (not including the PS Vita sequels or spin-offs), where we find clear examples of Jewish Esoteric Moralization (JEM), a subset of what mythologist Mark Brahmin calls <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/rem/">Racial Esoteric Moralization</a> (REM).</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3311">Abby, a character in The Last of Us Part 2, was “beefed up” in order to be more “trans friendly.”</p>, <p>JEM is a bit like Joseph Campbell’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero's_journey"><em>The Hero’s Journey</em></a> but with archetypes specifying <strong>racial</strong> groups. Whereas Campbell’s framework applies more or less universally, JEM encodes an incredibly specific <strong>racial subtext</strong> that champions Jewish men in resource competition with vilified White/European men. Often the battle is over sexual access to Aryan women. We refer to these groups as Semitic and Aryan (or Dionysian and Apollonian) respectively to clarify that this isn’t just a religious division.</p>, <p>That Jews have hidden a complex symbol language from us is not without precedent. The reader will no doubt be aware that they successfully hid the existence of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud#Middle_Ages">Talmud</a> from their European hosts for <em>hundreds of years</em>, and are <a href="https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2019/06/21/jewishness-and-the-culture-of-crypsis/">experts at crypsis</a>. However, it should be stressed that <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkBrahmin/status/1271447073737539589">not all Jews are cognizant</a> of the symbol language or would necessarily identify with its message. Indeed it appears that Jewish women are as benighted as Gentiles, as they are often the target of hatred and rejection in the JEM.</p>, <p>If every Jewish work of art was as obvious as <a href="https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2017/10/18/harvey-weinstein-on-jews-and-the-shiksa/"><em>Portnoy’s Complaint</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2017/10/31/jews-the-shiksa-ii-dustin-hoffman/"><em>The Graduate</em></a> or <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/02/21/meet-the-parents-as-semitic-bride-gathering-ballad-by-michael-frank/"><em>Meet The Parents</em></a>, even the dullest of Gentiles would catch on. With JEM, Jewish artists enjoy(ed) the freedom to subtly communicate and reinforce their worldview, safe in the knowledge that Whites would be blind to it. Take, for example, <a href="https://www.counter-currents.com/2010/11/uncharted-2/">this ill-informed piece</a> about <em>Uncharted 2</em> celebrating its supposed reinforcement of White endogamy. As will be demonstrated, precisely <em>the opposite</em> is true. Fittingly, the <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/05/07/the-micro-aggressing-evil-eye-the-hamsa-the-mark-and-the-third-eye/">blinding</a> and/or blindness of their enemies is a common motif.</p>, <p>Sometimes even non-White actors/characters portray an Aryan or Semitic cipher to camouflage the true meaning of a work. Brahmin emphasizes the importance of researching <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/what-is-in-a-name/">names</a> when examining esoteric art, as they’re often the key to identifying who is who. This is what we’ll be doing with <em>Uncharted</em>, as names cognate with Biblical and mythological archetypes (<a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/03/14/the-parabolist-law-of-microcosm-the-definition-of-a-god/">God Masking</a>), or that describe animals, plants, elements, colors, and other descriptors, can tell us if a character is Semitic or Aryan. For example, Apollo, Ares/Mars, and Zeus/Jupiter are archetypes that personify the Aryan male.</p>, <p>Today anti-White hostility is readily apparent in the media, but if you want to know when crafty Jewish authors are giving you the middle finger <em>behind the curtain</em> you must read Brahmin’s groundbreaking thesis at <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/"><em>The Apollonian Transmission</em></a> and in his upcoming books. It will open your eyes to a whole new world. The following analysis assumes you’re completely new to JEM, so you can pick it up as we go along.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3312">Naughty Dog vice president Neil Druckmann accepts awards for best writing in a video game at the 2014 and 2017 Writers Guild Awards for his work on The Last of Us and Uncharted 4.

It’s possible that none of his coworkers know about the subtext discussed below, but multiple Jews have held key positions on his titles. I bring this up not to suggest some sort of Jewish conspiracy (besides, perhaps, the oft-observed <a href="https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/category/jewish-ethnic-networking/">ethnic networking</a>), but rather because JEM is more likely given the circumstances. For example, lead writer Josh Scherr and lead designer Emilia Schatz are self-identified Jews. Several others have names and appearances that suggest Jewish ancestry (such as co-president <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/developer/shots/developerId,98062/">Evan Wells</a>).</p>, <p>Druckmann is curiously absent the third installment, <em>Drake’s Deception</em>, but I will touch upon aspects that appear to retain his signature. It follows that he made contributions given his involvement with the franchise. My guess is that he helped lay the groundwork but refused to put his name on it due to artistic differences with writer/director Amy Hennig, whom he later <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/03/05/uncharted-writerdirector-amy-hennig-reportedly-forced-out-at-naughty-dog">allegedly ousted</a> from the company.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> When he replaced Hennig as writer/director on the fourth game he scrapped much of her work, causing one of the key voice actors to quit due to “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/alan-tudyk-i-left-uncharted-4-over-weird-changes-to-script/">weird changes</a>” to the script.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>, <p class="has-background has-accent-background-color"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-3313 size-full" height="447" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" src="http://radixjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Uncharted05-kosher.jpg" srcset="https://radixjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Uncharted05-kosher.jpg 721w, https://radixjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Uncharted05-kosher-300x186.jpg 300w" width="721"/></p>, <p>The Indiana Jones of the <em>Uncharted</em> games is <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Nathan_Drake">Nathan Drake</a> (<em>né</em> Morgan). Note that on its own, a <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/03/15/biblical-aryans-and-understanding-biblical-genealogies/">Biblical or Hebrew name</a> does not guarantee that a character is a Jewish cipher in the JEM. The given name Nathan means “he gave,” while the longer Nathaniel means “god gave.” This is similar to the meaning of the Hebrew name John (lit. “graced by Yahweh” or “Yahweh is gracious”), the patronymic surname of Indiana Jones (lit. “son of John”). In other words, Yahweh has favored our protagonist.</p>, <p>Ironically, the Old English surname <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(given_name)">Drake</a> is what gives Nathan’s racial identity away; it’s a byname meaning “snake” or “dragon.” Ostensibly he adopted it after his childhood hero Sir Francis Drake, similar to Jones’ adoption of the nickname “Indiana.” Yet <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/02/08/garden-of-eden-part-iii-seth-as-serpent-seed-and-sargon-of-akkad-as-serpent/">the serpent</a> is one of the most important animal symbols in Jewish art – <a href="http://www.theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/11/06/the-blood-and-venom-of-the-serpent-the-juice-of-the-vine/">vines</a> and dragons are variants of it in the JEM – and these identify Semitic (or Judaized) figures.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Incidentally, Indiana Jones’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophidiophobia">ophidiophobia</a> (“<em>Why does it always have to be snakes?!</em>“) serves as an irreverent in-joke to cognizant Jews.</p>, <p>The surname Morgan isn’t mentioned much in the games. It appears to be a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_le_Fay">Morgan le Fay</a> of Arthurian legend, particularly “the unpredictable duality of her nature, with potential for both good and evil.”<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Indeed Drake’s penchant for murdering hundreds of men over the course of his adventures makes him the posterboy of what Clint Hocking terms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludonarrative_dissonance">ludonarrative dissonance</a>. Druckmann has addressed and rejected this criticism,<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> as Drake’s real surname is an esoteric admission that he was never intended to be a paragon of morality.</p>, <p>The name Morgan has its own meaning which relates to Drake’s Jewish nature. It stems from the Old Welsh “Morcant” meaning “sea chief,” “sea protector,” “sea defender,” or “sailor/captain,” which may be a Biblical reference to Noah and Noah’s Ark. Indeed, both <em>Uncharted 1</em> and <em>Uncharted 4</em> begin with Drake aboard a boat, and water-based settings figure throughout the franchise. This is significant as water is an Aryan element in the JEM related to <a href="http://www.theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/03/26/baptism-and-anointing-a-symbol-for-copulation-with-aryan-women/">blood and admixture</a>.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Hence the surname implies that Drake is the master or shepherd of the Aryan flock and that he’s a casanova among its female sheep (his “ark”). This interpretation is corroborated by plot details discussed next.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3314">Nathan Drake, our crypto-Jewish hero, as seen in Uncharted 4.</p>, <p>Before we continue, neophytes should understand one of the key themes of the JEM. Namely, Jewish authors such as Druckmann are encoding a “mating call” in their work, which is well illustrated in <em>Uncharted</em>. The objects of their desire are blonde, blue-eyed (Aryan) women. The Jewish obsession with blondes is <a href="https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2011/07/12/how-rachel-weisz-wrecked-her-hollywood-prospects/">well-documented</a>,<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> and it is why Brahmin proposes that Judaism is a <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/the-bride-gathering-cult/">Semitic bride gathering cult</a>.

If perhaps a bit of a stretch, Elena’s hunt for news scoops can be interpreted as a reference to the Goddess of the Hunt, Artemis/Diana. All things considered Elena is a distinctly <em>non-Jewish</em> love interest, while Drake is akin to the seducing serpent in the Garden of Eden. Drake even engages in “<a href="https://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/11/28/the-neg-ing-jewish-husband-and-the-christian-wife/">neg-ing</a>” when he cruelly abandons Elena part way through their first adventure together.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> When they reunite she eventually forgives the betrayal, accepting that his aloofness is part of his roguish charm.</p>, <p>The sequel takes place sometime later when their relationship is on the rocks.

Jeff is a potential rival for Elena’s affections, but he’s immediately eliminated when he’s shot and killed by some enemy soldiers. Thus we’re not terribly concerned if he was an Aryan or Semitic sexual competitor. What’s important is that with Jeff out of the picture, Druckmann has set up a love triangle between Drake, Elena, and Chloe. Given that Elena is a blonde, blue-eyed woman and Chloe is an Indian-European mix with black hair and tanned skin, no points for guessing who he ends up with. The bride gathering cult is, at its heart, a eugenics cult desiring Aryan features.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3317">Chloe and Elena meet in Uncharted 2.</p>, <p>Drake and Elena have more adventures together in the third game, get married, and by the end of the fourth game have a daughter named <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Cassie_Drake">Cassie</a>. She’s an example of the Cassandra archetype,<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> a character from Greco-Roman myth who rejects Apollo’s romantic advances. To be clear, the JEM archetype differs from the prevailing “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra_(metaphor)">Cassandra metaphor</a>.” The archetype is deployed to demoralize White men as Cassandra(s) reject them in favor of non-White sexual partners.</p>, <p>Hence Drake and Elena’s daughter Cassie, although just a child, has been set up to reject a White suitor in line with the archetype. This is the sort of subtle racial slights that Jews can incorporate into a story; should Cassie feature in future installments, I predict that she’ll be paired with a Jewish or non-White love interest.</p>, <p>In fact, there are two examples of the Cassandra archetype in the <em>Uncharted</em> series as <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Cassandra_Morgan">Drake’s mother</a> is also named Cassandra. Thus, we infer that she was an Aryan woman who chose to marry a non-Aryan man. This tells us that Drake inherited his Jewishness from his father, an arrangement not uncommon in the JEM,<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> which reinforces the notion that <a href="http://www.theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/02/03/the-bride-gathering-cult-part-iii-jews-the-greatest-of-the-admixed-types/">Jews are inherently admixed</a> while simultaneously corroborating Brahmin’s concept of the <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/02/05/the-chosen-bride-the-matrilineal-ruse/">matrilineal ruse</a>.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3318">Drake’s mother and daughter reference the Greco-Roman figure Cassandra, who famously denied Apollo’s advances. Note the subtly Jewish features of Cassie’s face.

His given name is self-explanatory, but the nickname Sully means “south meadow,” where the South is typically understood as a non-Aryan realm (in contrast to the Hyperborean North). The same designation applies to the East versus the West, hence “Sully” seems to be a Semitic ally.</p>, <p>This is corroborated by the meaning of the Irish surname Sullivan, which stems from the basic word <em>súil</em> (lit. “eye”). The latter half of the name is contested; in full it can mean “one-eyed,” “quick eyed,” “little dark-eyed one,” or “hawk eyed.” This ambiguity is actually handy from the esotericist’s point of view, as the name can reference multiple mythological figures to convey Sully’s personality and archetype.</p>, <p>If Sullivan means “one-eyed,” he’s likely channeling the one-eyed Norse god Odin. However, if the name means “hawk eyed,” Sully is posing as the Arthurian wizard Merlin (there’s a species of pigeon-hawk called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(bird)">merlin</a>). Indeed Druckmann may be intelligently referencing both of these figures, who, like Sully, are wizened tricksters. Frequent references to <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2018/12/26/norse-myth-as-jewish-esoteric-moralization/">Norse myth</a> (handed down to us from the Church) and <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/01/24/arthurian-legend-as-deleterious-myth/">Arthurian legend</a> appear in the JEM, and these myths appear to hew closely to the symbol language. Later, we’ll see the odd reference built upon symbols from Incan mythology as well as Hinduism/Buddhism, but these are outliers/one-offs from my personal study of JEM.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3319">Victor “Sully” Sullivan is Drake’s mentor and partner in crime, a trickster like Odin and Merlin.

The sudden appearance of a down-on-his-luck older brother brings up an interesting motif in the JEM whereby siblings (especially brothers) may be <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/02/20/aryans-as-first-born-jews-as-second-born-the-curse-of-cain/"><em>racial rivals</em></a>.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> However, the name Samuel tends to be a Semitic identifier in the JEM so the Drakes don’t appear to follow this pattern. His Hebrew name means “God listened” or “God heard,”<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> suggesting God has answered Nathan’s prayers with Samuel’s reappearance.</p>, <p>The Biblical Samuel is the “king maker,” and Sam fits this role perfectly. Nathan has given up “treasure-hunting” (having married Elena) and is living a mundane existence; it is Sam’s return that coaxes Nathan into joining one last adventure. Sam surreptitiously collects some pirate gold during their quest, which is later used to purchase the company that Nathan works for (Nathan takes over as boss, becoming “king”). As a result, Nathan and Elena are set for life when they complete the treasure salvage in Malaysia that his former boss had been planning.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3320">Sam, the “king maker,” rescues his brother from his life of doldrums.</p>, <p>In <em>Uncharted: Among Thieves</em>, Drake befriends an old German explorer living in the Himalayas who was originally hired by the German National Socialists to find the entrance to <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Shambhala">Shambhala</a>. His name is <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Karl_Schäfer">Karl Schäfer</a>, which reveals that he’s another Semitic cipher. Characters named Karl and its cognates compose what Brahmin terms <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/03/15/the-frankish-motif-appearing-in-jem-jews-as-franks/">the Frankish motif</a>. His surname means “shepherd,” an occupation that aligns with Semitic archetypes such as Moses and <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/05/21/mercury-the-philosopher-priest-prophet-apostle-wizard-and-deceiver/">Hermes/Mercury</a>. As the latter was a “soul guide” to the Underworld or afterlife, Karl’s role is to guide Drake towards Shambhala, which is synonymous with Heaven or paradise.</p>, <p>It’s possible there’s another example of the Frankish motif in the third game, where we find the Englishman <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Charlie_Cutter">Charlie Cutter</a> (Charles is a cognate of Karl). Despite his Anglo-Saxon name and appearance, Charlie is Drake’s trustworthy brother-in-arms. His surname, originally an occupational name for a cloth cutter, may also suggest <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/04/08/jem-in-fairy-tales-and-european-folklore/">a woodcutter</a>. Wood is a symbol representing the Aryan as a consumable resource for the <a href="https://theapolloniantransmission.com/2018/12/23/semitic-earth-fire-gods/">Jewish Fire God</a>, wood that Charlie metaphorically “chops down” when killing foes.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>, <p>In the fourth game, we learn that Drake’s employer <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Jameson">Jameson</a> is married to a woman named Karla. It’s a minor detail for a character we’ll never meet, but it’s patterns like this that confirm the symbol language is at play. What’s important here is that these characters are Drake’s allies, which is why Brahmin suggests the Frankish empire was either Jewish, philo-Semitic, or inadvertently aligned with Jewish interests. We’ll see several historical references to anti-Semitic figures next, in the manner of <em>Indiana Jones</em>‘ <a href="https://lucasfilm.fandom.com/wiki/René_Emile_Belloq">Belloq</a> (a reference to the writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilaire_Belloc#Accusations_of_antisemitism">Hilaire Belloc</a>).</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3321">Karl Schäfer and Charlie Cutter, possible examples of the Frankish motif. Note that Charlie wears black and green, Semitic colors in the JEM symbolism.</p>, <p><a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Atoq_Navarro">Atoq Navarro</a>, a Peruvian Mestizos archeologist – and thus Drake’s treasure-hunting rival – is the main antagonist in the first game. His given name stems from Incan astronomy where a <a href="https://futurism.com/the-dark-constellations-of-the-incas">dark constellation</a> called Atoq represents the fox.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> The fox may function as a Semitic identifier related to the Teumessian Fox of Greco-Roman mythology, while the surname “Fox” and its cognates are also common Jewish names (note that Drake thinks Crash Bandicoot is a fox in <em>Uncharted 4</em>). In Incan mythology the fox is a thief that is said to have deceived the gods. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_mythology#Foxes">Wikipedia</a> states:</p>, <p>“(T)he deity Cuniraya Viracocha was angered by a fox and stated that, ‘As for you, even when you skulk around keeping your distance, people will thoroughly despise you and say ‘That fox is a thief!’ When they kill you they’ll carelessly throw you away and your skin too.’ In other narratives, the fox is said to have tried to steal the moon but the moon hugged the fox close which resulted in the spots on the moon.”<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>, <p>These details are thematically appropriate. The latter anecdote arguably posits Atoq as a Semitic figure <em>via</em> an association with <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/04/05/sin-as-an-original-jewish-god/">the Moon God Sin</a>.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> Alternatively the fox and Moon’s embrace dovetails with Atoq’s kidnapping of Elena, as she is associated with the Moon <em>via</em> the <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/07/08/the-daphne-motif-and-the-problem-with-laurels/">Artemis Daphnaia motif</a>.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>, <p>“Navarro” is a Spanish and Sephardi Jewish surname, further hinting that he’s a Semitic figure.

Note Atoq wears black (a Semitic color) while Roman wears white and blue (Aryan colors).</p>, <p>The tertiary villain is an Indonesian treasure hunter named <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Eddy_Raja">Eddy Raja</a>. Raja is an Indian name meaning “king,” where names indicating royalty commonly identify Aryan characters in the JEM.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> Thus despite his surface-level race, Eddy can be read as a historical reference to King Edward I, who famously issued the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Expulsion">Edict of Expulsion</a> in 1290. Hence he’s an inherently anti-Semitic villain! Indeed Raja manages to capture and imprison our hero, but Elena breaks Drake out of his prison cell (a bit like Oliver Cromwell “freeing” the Jews).</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3323">Eddy Raja is a reference to King Edward I. Note that he wears bright yellow and gold jewelry (Aryan colors/metal).</p>, <p class="has-background has-accent-background-color">The main villain in the second game is a Serbian war criminal named <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Zoran_Lazarević">Zoran Lazarević</a>. Zoran is a common Slavic name, the masculine form of Zora, which means “dawn” or “daybreak.” It comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorya">Zorya</a> of Slavic mythology, “the two guardian goddesses, known as the Auroras. . . the Morning Star and the Evening Star.”<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> To wit, Druckmann is drawing a line between these Slavic goddesses and their Greco-Roman counterparts Eos/Aurora (the Goddess of Dawn), and Hesperus/Venus (the Evening Star). Indeed the Slavic name Zora is etymologically linked to Zohra, the <em>Islamic</em> name for the Planet Venus!</p>, <p>Saliently the masculine form of the name is linked to Lucifer (also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer">the dawn-bringer</a> and Morning Star). Brahmin argues that <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/05/30/esoteric-apollo-lucifer-an-imperfect-name-describing-an-aryan-god/">Lucifer</a> is an epithet for Apollo,<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> implying Zoran is a god-masked Apollo. The smoking gun? Zoran’s official bio in <em>Uncharted 4</em> informs us that he had a “love for the writings of Neitzsche,” whose philosophy famously proposed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche#Apollonian_and_Dionysian">Apollonian Dionysian dichotomy</a>. That Apollo is repeatedly vilified as the personification of the “anti-Semitic Aryan” by Jewish authors is one of several reasons why Brahmin suggests we should <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/05/03/why-apolloism-is-3-0-2/">embrace Apollo</a> as our representative God.</p>, <p>The Serbian surname Lazarević is derived from the Hebrew name אֶלְעָזָר (<em>Elʿazar</em> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleazar"><em>Eleazar</em></a>), meaning “God has helped,” likely because Zoran manages to obtain the power of the story’s MacGuffin in the finale (though Drake still manages to defeat him). This heals Zoran’s burn scars which covered part of his face (an allusion to a fateful encounter with the <a href="https://theapolloniantransmission.com/2018/12/23/semitic-earth-fire-gods/">Jewish Fire God</a>, perhaps?). Alternatively the surname may describe Apollo as naturally gifted.</p>, <p>As a Serbian war criminal we can assume that Zoran is guilty of ethnic cleansing. This is likely a veiled criticism of the Apollo Cult’s eugenic <a href="https://theapolloniantransmission.com/2018/12/22/the-cult-of-apollo-part-i-a-eugenics-cult/">Thargelia rituals</a>, yet constitutes what Brahmin calls <a href="https://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/10/16/cep-conscious-ethnic-projection-in-jewish-religion-art-politics-and-life/">Conscious Ethnic Projection</a> (CEP) given Israel’s crimes against the Palestinians.

Here the stone is depicted as a blue orb in the center of a white tree referred to as the Tree of Life. The sphere’s blue coloration, which matches the sky and the Aryan’s blue eyes, indicates it is an Aryan power source.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> This plot device strikingly communicates the bride gathering cult’s obsession with the Aryan as a rejuvenating genetic resource.

In contrast, Marlowe’s second-in-command is a man simply named Talbot, which means “messenger of destruction.” It seems to me that <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Talbot">Talbot</a> is one of Hennig’s creations, named in homage of David Talbot, the head of a similar secret society in Anne Rice’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Body_Thief"><em>The Tale of the Body Thief</em></a>. Hennig had previously worked on games starring vampires, so it follows that she’d be a fan of Rice’s work.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3327">Katherine “Kate” Marlowe is likely an allusion to Hecate/Trivia, a witch-like archetype in the JEM. Sister Catherine, seen briefly in Uncharted 4, is another example. She’s a strict nun who watches over the young Drake during his stay at a Catholic orphanage.</p>, <p>Druckmann was back in the driver’s seat for the fourth game. Here we find an imaginary villain named <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Hector_Alcázar">Hector Alcázar</a>. In Brahmin’s estimation Hector – the legendary Trojan killed by Achilles – is a Semitic figure.<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> The Spanish surname is a word for a type of Moorish castle or palace, as well as a habitational name for someone from Spain, suggesting perhaps Sephardi Jewish roots (indeed Hector looks as though he could be Drake’s father!). Alternatively, it may suggest the infamous <a href="http://castlemania.i11.co/alcatras.html">island prison Alcatras</a>, as Sam supposedly befriended Hector while the two were inmates in prison.</p>, <p>It is my suspicion that Alcázar, as “Butcher of Panama,” is a historical reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Noriega">Manuel Noriega Moreno</a>. “Moreno” is a Spanish, Portuguese, and Sephardi Jewish surname, possibly a derivative of the classical Latin “Maurus” meaning “Moor” (which would tie into the aforementioned meaning of Alcázar). Perhaps Druckmann is telling us that Noriega was a Jew. Alternatively Noriega’s ties to the United States intelligence agencies made him a puppet, an “imaginary villain,” just like Alcázar. This relates to Brahmin’s concept of the Caducean phenomenon.</p>, <p>The real villain is a White man named <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Rafe_Adler">Rafe Adler</a>. His given name (pronounced like “safe”) has multiple origins, the most likely being the Old Norse variant which means “counsel of the wolf,” or “wise wolf.” The wolf is an <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/05/07/esoteric-apollo-the-totem-of-wolf-as-pseudo-praise/">animal totem</a> commonly assigned to Aryan characters in the JEM.<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> Here it is paired with a German surname that means “eagle.” This is revealing, as both the wolf and the eagle are among Zeus/Jupiter’s sacred animals. Thus at bare minimum Adler is a clearly defined Aryan villain, if not a god-masked Zeus (Zeus is an Aryan god hated for having exiled <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2020/02/20/saturn-a-form-of-the-jewish-god-seven-a-reference-to-saturn/">Saturn</a> and <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/04/27/vulcan-as-an-important-form-of-the-lesser-god/">Vulcan</a>, the latter two being important Semitic deities in the JEM).</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3328">Nadine Ross and Rafe Adler in Uncharted 4.</p>, <p>A black woman named <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Nadine_Ross">Nadine Ross</a> is Adler’s accomplice. Her given name is of Arabic origin meaning “<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/admonitory">admonitory</a>/messenger,” which is contradicted by its secondary meaning of “Showerer of blessings.” Thus she’s indicated as neither good nor evil, or someone between an ally and a villain. Indeed she does not seem terribly concerned with killing Drake, and would later star in the spin-off <em>Uncharted: Lost Legacy</em> alongside Chloe as her partner in crime.</p>, <p>Her surname may descend from the Gaelic word for “headland,” which is “a narrow piece of land that projects from a <strong>coastline</strong> into the sea.” This clearly relates to her paramilitary outfit “Shoreline.” It can also mean “a strip of land left unplowed at the end of a field,” which implies she is neither sexually penetrated nor inseminated, i.e. a virgin.</p>, <p>These clues imply that Nadine is a god-masked Athena Parthenos, virgin goddess of war (and one of Zeus’ children). More specifically, as a black woman Nadine appears to venerate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Bernal">Martin Bernal</a>‘s (discredited) theory of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Athena">Black Athena</a>,” which is based on Plato’s notion that Athena was originally inspired by the “war-like” Egyptian goddess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neith">Neith</a>.</p>, <p>Moreover these meanings imply Nadine is a lesbian: In the JEM symbolism, water represents the Aryan as an aqueous resource, so if “Ross” means something like “peninsula,” Nadine is posited as the hard, masculine, earthen element penetrating the sea. The sexual connotation of “unplowed field” still applies as fully compatible with lesbianism.<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> Athena mourned the accidental killing of her beloved friend Pallas by taking her name, becoming “Pallas Athena,” the implication being they were more than friends. Indeed an official holiday illustration depicts Nadine and Chloe blushing under the mistletoe.</p>, <p>Often JEM takes the form of a parable where important historical conflicts are reduced to <a href="http://www.theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/03/14/the-parabolist-law-of-microcosm-the-definition-of-a-god/">a microcosm</a>. Let’s explore a simple example from <em>Uncharted 4</em>, when Drake spends some time in a Panamanian prison. This section of the game begins with a fist fight between him and a Spanish-speaking prisoner named Gustavo. “Gustavo” is the Spanish version of the Old Swedish name “Gustaf,” meaning “staff of the Geats.” To wit, Drake’s conflict with this “Spanish” thug is a parable of the Jewish struggle for dominance in Visigothic Spain reduced to a microcosm.</p>, <p>The fight is interrupted by a crooked prison warden named <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Vargas">Vargas</a>, who’s a minor villain. His is a Spanish habitational name stemming from a knight named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid#Middle_Ages">Iván de Vargas</a> who “distinguished himself in the (re)conquest of Madrid,”<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> allowing Christians to supplant Muslims at the center of the city. The reader will be aware that Jews opened the gates to the <a href="https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2016/03/27/moorish-spain-a-successful-multicultural-paradise/">Moorish invasion of Spain</a>, so Vargas is yet another reference to an historical anti-Semitic villain. Both Gustavo and Vargas will meet their demise as Drake escapes – effectively a “dunk” on Catholic Spain, which is a sore spot for Jews due to the counter-Semitic measures taken during the Spanish Inquisition.</p>, <p>As we saw in <em>Uncharted 2</em>, names cognate with Henry often indicate a god-masked Apollo – Jewry’s archnemesis. This appears to be the case with Druckmann’s reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Every">Henry Avery</a>, a legendary pirate, in <em>Uncharted 4</em>. In the game’s plot we learn that Henry Avery founded a pirate utopia called Libertalia with the help of eleven other legendary pirates. The “twelve pirates” who pooled their gold together are possibly the deities of the Greco-Roman pantheon related to <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/03/11/the-zodiac-as-a-propaganda-coup-and-the-semitic-nature-of-greek-heroes/">the Zodiac</a>.<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46"><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>, <p>Henry tried to take the colony’s treasure hoard for himself, and poisoned the other pirates with the help of an accomplice named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tew">Thomas Tew</a>. This may represent Apollo supplanting the other gods to become the most important deity. However, he failed: Thomas stabbed Henry in the back in an attempt to take the treasure for himself. In the finale we learn that Henry and Thomas killed one another.</p>, <p>Characters named Tom are often Christ figures in the JEM where the apostle “Doubting Thomas” is considered the “twin of Christ” (indeed Thomas means “twin” in Hebrew).<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> Thus the rise and fall of Libertalia, with its ill-fated Apollo and Christ figures, may be a parable of Christ’s victory over Apollo and the collapse of the Ancient Roman Empire.<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> Of course, Christ was crucified by the Romans and so Thomas Tew never made it out alive, either.</p>, <p>However, there may also be an encoded political message here. Note the similarity between <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Henry_Avery">Henry Avery’s pirate sigil</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones society’s logo</a>. Iconography present in Henry’s mansion points to his organization being something akin to Freemasonry, which would apply to Skull and Bones. Also note that Skull and Bones was started by <em>two key figures</em>, and had <em>twelve</em> original members. Hence the game’s backstory may communicate that Skull and Bones was an Aryan movement attempting to rob America that collapsed due to the Christian beliefs of its members.</p>, <p>Skull and Bones (a.k.a. Order 322) is an important organization in American politics and one that seems to be referenced in films. Take <a href="https://youtu.be/UsoYwysCdfY?t=128">the famous football scene</a> from <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> for example, in which a luxury suite numbered 322 explodes. The stadium where this scene was filmed does not contain a suite with that number, suggesting the detail is a deliberate reference. See also the Prescott family (i.e. Prescott Bush, a member of Skull and Bones) in <em><a href="https://theapolloniantransmission.com/2020/01/17/the-hidden-meaning-of-life-is-strange-twin-peaks-the-eleusinian-mysteries-racial-esoteric-moralization-by-hugo-adrian/">Life is Strange</a></em>.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3329">Henry Avery, whom Drake refers to as a “paranoid psychopath,” has a golden harp in his mansion. The harp is one of Apollo’s symbols. Also note the sunbursts on the floor and the golden suns on the doors in the mansion, more Apollonian symbols. On the doors, beneath the sun, there’s an encoded Masonic compass which is missing its partner, the square.</p>, <p>There is much, much, more to explore, but for brevity’s sake I will highlight only a few examples. In many areas the correct path forward is subtly marked with yellow, which guides the player as if on a “yellow brick road.” Yellow, like gold, is an Aryan color corresponding with blond hair and the sun. Blue is also an Aryan color due to the Aryan’s blue eyes. Take note where blue and yellow are combined in props or costumes. <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/05/01/the-color-green-robin-hood-may-day/">Green</a>,<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> on the other hand, is a Semitic color, while “<a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/07/04/captain-marvel-part-ii-the-christian-kree-and-the-jewish-skrulls/">purple</a> is where an Aryan blue meets red, the color of vulnerability to admixture.”<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> Thus Drake wears a <strong>green</strong> shirt and Elena wears a <strong>purple</strong> shirt as they share dinner and a passionate kiss in <em>Uncharted 4</em>.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3330">Costume colors matching the esoteric racial identities and themes appear in this scene from Uncharted 4.</p>, <p class="has-background has-accent-background-color"> JEM number symbolism is also present (keep your eyes peeled for the number six), as is Hebraic gematria. For example, in <em>Uncharted 4</em> the Saint Francis cathedral – the orphanage where Drake stays as a boy – is addressed 1016. In Hebraic gematria, <a href="http://www.billheidrick.com/works/hgm5/hg1000.htm#1016">1016</a> corresponds to a Hebrew word meaning “what is redundant or overlapping.” This is a religious slight describing Christianity from a Jewish perspective. Other associations with 1016 appear in <a href="http://www.billheidrick.com/works/hgm3/hg0360.htm#366">366</a>, where we find “Alliance” (describing Drake and Sam or St. Francis as a crypto-Jew <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/05/24/the-logical-proof-of-jewish-control-of-the-church/">allied with the Catholic church</a>) and <a href="http://www.billheidrick.com/works/hgm3/hg0450.htm#456">456</a>, “an orphan; a fatherless child” (reflecting Drake’s childhood).</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3331">The Saint Francis cathedral is addressed 1016, corresponding to meaningful Hebrew words via gematria.</p>, <p>Eagle-eyed players could have a field day sifting out all of the JEM tropes. Perhaps the most noteworthy motif is the franchise’s general focus on flashy water effects. Throughout the series, Drake will navigate river rapids on a sea-doo, infiltrate a tanker as it’s tossed about at sea, escape a sinking cruise ship, and so on. Ostensibly Naughty Dog’s designers wanted to show off the technical power of the Playstation with their visual effects wizardry. Yet as mentioned earlier, <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/03/26/baptism-and-anointing-a-symbol-for-copulation-with-aryan-women/">water</a> (especially fresh water) is an important symbol representing the Aryan as an essential resource (Semites are a desert-dwelling people, after all).</p>, <p>That Naughty Dog’s games contain Jewish Esoteric Moralization raises serious concerns about Druckmann’s leadership. Dissidents will certainly want to boycott the company, but what about the studio itself? Can straight, White, Christian men working under his regime truly expect fair and equal treatment, given his deep-seated racial/religious bias? How many non-Jewish employees have been passed over for promotion, simply because they’re the “enemy”? And has he made any passes at blondes working there, such as the actresses he hires to portray his characters?</p>, <p>Of course until JEM becomes a widely known phenomenon Druckmann can deny and deflect with <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/03/01/names-part-ii-the-importance-of-names-in-rem-common-names-exoteric-alibis/">exoteric alibis</a>. Yet the scandal surrounding Amy Hennig’s departure from the company seems to be the clincher. As mentioned, despite her industry experience Hennig was allegedly “<a href="https://gamerant.com/naughty-dog-amy-hennig-forced-departure-uncharted/">forced out</a>” by Druckmann and Bruce Straley. This analysis reveals the likely motive: Her ideas were simply incompatible with the esoteric subtext Druckmann sought to insert! Hypothetically, he could <a href="https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/category/jewish-ethnic-networking/">rally his co-ethnic male peers</a> to his side but had to leave her in the dark. And so he and Straley allegedly “stonewalled” her, which must have been personally and professionally devastating to her.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3332">Three’s a crowd: Amy Hennig was allegedly forced out of the company by Neil Druckmann and Bruce Straley.</p>, <p>Hennig is a cut above most video game writers, but like most non-Jewish authors she probably thinks of her work as having no purpose beyond entertainment. It should be self-evident that the intricacy and purpose behind Druckmann’s work is, in its own way, impressive and imitable. If left unchallenged, he will no doubt become something like the Steven Spielberg or Stan Lee of video games. His other baby, <em>The Last of Us</em>, is widely acclaimed – despite its many shortcomings in game design – purely because of its production value and story.</p>, <p>Brahmin argues we must treat our own Art with the same care and respect because of its power to shape the culture and attitudes of our people. A “<a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/03/07/a-return-to-sophistication/">return to sophistication</a>,”<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> both in how we write stories and interpret them, will inevitably require “<a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/05/03/myth-and-symbol-language-part-i-the-importance-of-establishing-an-agreed-upon-shared-symbolism/">the establishment of an agreed upon, shared symbolism</a>.”<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> Race-conscious White writers can begin the process of <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/01/23/r-e-m-part-i-a-i-m-versus-j-e-m/">moralizing our people</a> by simply reversing the way in which Greco-Roman archetypes are deployed in the JEM (for some quick tips, <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/the-parabolists-quick-reference-guide-for-creating-aim/">click here</a>). Applying Roman Interpretation to Jewish art is an education in itself that will yield many important building blocks.</p>, <p>Lastly, I feel Sony should send in a Japanese task force to radically restructure Naughty Dog from top to bottom. This likely won’t happen, but the debacle surrounding <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> and its bizarre political agenda would provide the perfect cover for terminating Druckmann’s employment. Hennig could be invited back as the lead writer/director, which would signal a return to form while pleasing stalwart fans. At the very least Sony should audit the software marketed by former Naughty Dog employee Andrew Maximov called “<a href="https://www.prometheanai.com/">Promothean A.I.</a>” to determine if he has stolen any of the studio’s intellectual property. <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2018/12/23/the-promethean-and-atlatean-terribly-abused-and-misused-words/">Prometheus</a> is, after all, a Semitic figure who stole fire from the Gods.</p>, <p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Rubin directed the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Bandicoot"><em>Crash Bandicoot</em></a> games, which are legitimately good, as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_and_Daxter"><em>Jak &amp; Daxter</em></a> trilogy (which are solid if not spectacular).

Is this something that can be fully separated from radicals in our movement? Maybe not completely, however, just like the addict in the opium den, so too, are nationalists being consumed in reverie over any time period that they never lived in, and in place of progression is a great wheat field image induced stagnation that breeds depression and resentment.</p>, <p>Third position ideas do require reflection on our past, which can justifiably create immense admiration, but if only for the purpose of moving forward. Jewish Filmmaker Woody Allen, seems to understand the negative effects of nostalgia and seemingly gifts us with his 2011 film, Midnight In Paris. A film that displays how this trance-like state of yearning for the past can seriously complicate your present. The only problem is Allen, I feel, is speaking to a very specific audience and that audience is us. Thus, he is careful to not encourage us too much and, as you will read below, I believe he has a more nefarious purpose for this messaging.</p>, <p><strong>OVERVIEW OF MIDNIGHT IN PARIS</strong></p>, <p><strong> </strong>Midnight in Paris, written and directed by Woody Allen, is a quirky tale of a screenwriter seemingly at an impasse. Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), is vacationing in Paris with his fiancee, Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents John and Helen. As we can see right off the bat, Gil and Inez couldn’t be more different than one another. Gil is very lackadaisical while Inez is explicitly high maintenance and intense. Inez’s parents have nothing but disdain for Gil and his ostensibly aloof and unserious personality. Gil is almost finished with his first novel about a man working in a nostalgia shop. Inez is not impressed or encouraging with this novel and wishes he would stick to screenwriting due to to his success in Hollywood. Inez is also annoyed at Gils’ insistence that they should live in Paris indefinitely due to his nostalgic euphoria over the Paris of the 1920’s.</p>, <p>Paul, who is a friend of Inez, and his wife happen to be in Paris at the same time as them. She admits to Gil she had a “crush” on Paul in college to which a clearly jealous Gil describes him as “Pedantic” and “Pseudo-intellectual”. Inez is clearly infatuated with Paul while Gil cannot stand him. Paul is a very dapper man who speaks with confidence and with every chance he gets, he tries to be the smartest man in the room. Even when he is contradicted by a tour guide about the artist Rodin and his tryst with his wife and mistress, Paul will not relent and keeps insisting he is right (and as the viewer can find out if they look into the life of Rodin, the tour guide was correct).</p>, <p>Gil and Inez have a night of drinking with Paul and his wife until Gil opts for a walk around the city of Paris alone to take the city it all in while Inez leaves with Paul and his wife in a taxi. Gil stops on his walk to figure out where he is exactly and as soon as the clock strikes midnight, a 1920’s vehicle pulls up in front of Gil. The passengers, also dressed from the 20’s, invite him to join them. It is at this point Gil is transported back in time to what he sees as the Golden Age of Paris. The 1920’s. This allows for an entertaining list of famous characters from the time to enter the plot such as Ernest Hemingway, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, Cole Porter, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and more.</p>, <p>Every night Gil transports himself back in time to meet all these artistic giants of the 20th century while his wife spends her time with Paul and, supposedly, his wife. After Hemingway brings Gil to Gertrude Stein’s flat so that he may have his novel analyzed, he meets Adriana (Marianne Cotillard). They have an instant connection and Gil becomes conflicted with this new flame that he has in the past and his current fiancee.</p>, <p>After visiting an Antique vendor in the present day, he finds Adriana’s diary where she has written a passage about her love for Gil. This encourages him to go back in time once more so that they may communicate their feelings for one another. They do so,and as they kiss at midnight, a horse drawn carriage pulls up in front of them and a well dressed couple invites them in. They are then transported to the 1890’s which is the true Golden Age, according to Adriana. After she is offered a job to make costumes for the theater, she decides to stay but Gil cannot. He realizes that everybody is bored with the age in which they live and they won’t find their meaning by going back. He decides the present is where he should remain and they choose to part.</p>, <p>Once in the present, Gil realizes Inez may be cheating on him with Paul (a discovery made by Hemingway after he reads Gil’s novel; Gertrude Stein then relates to Gil that Hemingway could not believe the protagonist did not see his fiancee was having an affair right before his eyes with “the pedantic one”) and when he confronts her, she admits to doing so but that he needs to just “get over it”. Gil seems rather pleased and takes this moment to tell her he will stay in Paris and they are not right for one another. In the end, we see Gil walking, yet again, through the city of Paris and at midnight he bumps into a young beautiful antique vendor he met earlier in the film. They walk off together through the streets, in the rain, which is where Gil always felt happiest.</p>, <p><strong>WOODY ALLEN &amp; THE ARYAN</strong></p>, <p><strong> </strong>What does this film mean, and more importantly, what does it mean for nationalists? In a way, Allen is giving an honest critique of reactionary thought. Not living in the now and spending ones time only in the past can produce untold unhappiness in the present. Gil is frustrated with how he is presently living. He dreams of a before time when to him everything was great. We see this many a time in politics. For a typical Republican, perhaps it’s America in the 50’s. To some 1930s Europe. To others medieval times and there are even those that believe that in the days of cavemen things were far more ideal. Which ever time one finds themselves pining for, Allen is telling the viewer that it is the present we should be focused in but how exactly is he portraying the present?</p>, <p>The film opens with a series of static shots that appear almost like paintings to display the very best of Paris. Throughout the film, the city is always ever present as another character in the story. While indeed very inspiring and breathtaking, it is obvious Woody Allen has only picked very select parts of the city. What we know of Paris today is that it is a shell of its former self. Even in 2011, during the films release, migrant hell holes burrowed their way into the city along with the trash that covers the streets. Culture in Paris is waning and the very best parts of the city are only preserved for the sake of tourism and not for the French soul. I doubt Allen is ignorant to any this. Quite the opposite. I believe this was a calculated decision on his part to ensure that we don’t spend much time in the past but to also accept our present as being more than sufficient, therefore we have no need to look to our future. As Nationalists, we are inspired by our past which Allen is more than aware, and as I’ve stated before we take elements from our Golden Age (whenever that may be) so that we may apply it to our lives in order to create a different future than the one that has been currently decided for us. Allen is careful to not encourage us too much. He wants you to stay forever in the present and to imprison your passion within the confines of a “this is good enough” type of attitude.</p>, <p>How do we know Allen is speaking to us? Some subtle clues in his body of work, as well as Midnight in Paris specifically, give us an indication of who he is speaking to. One of the ways we can find these clues is through name recognition which you can learn through the work of Mark Brahmin and his work in Jewish Esoteric Moralization also known as JEM. Many Jewish filmmakers pick very specific names in order to indicate who is an “Aryan” and who is a “Jew”. Gil can be translated to a few different meanings. Foolish, simpleton, and happy (which can hint at a happiness out of ignorance) are among those meanings which makes sense when you view this blonde and blue eyed character in the film. JEM often portrays the Aryan figure as gullible and generally oblivious.</p>, <p>It’s not that Gil is an ignorant man by any means it is more that he is a bit unaware of his surroundings and can be easily manipulated. Two women in his life that are Jewish signifiers, Inez (Who’s father is a Jewish figure named John who is also a neocon) and Adriana (meaning black, which is a Jewish signifier), merely have Gil around for their temporary entertainment. Adriana, for example, writes in her diary that her reasons for loving Gil are that he is “naive and unassuming”. Paul Bates, being short for Bartholomew which is a Jewish signifier, even cuckolds Gil. The Jewish figure steals the Aryans woman away from him.</p>, <p>While there are several symbols and other names that we can delve into, the point is that Allen is giving, in my opinion, a direct message to the “goy”. Jews are very fearful of an inspired Aryan people which may lead to uprisings as we have seen in the past. Since film is possibly the most versatile art form in history, it would behoove one such as Woody Allen to not only entertain his audience but to also influence them in a way that he feels benefits him through subversive means.</p>, <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>, <p>Nostalgia, while being quite natural, can be a trap. Gil experienced this well enough. While its aroma can be alluring, it has been the great motivator of inaction among Nationalists currently. I cannot emphasize enough that we can, and should, look to days gone by to find inspiration and ideas that we can use or even update to create a future. But A movement must have vision. Vision requires forward thinking. There is no return to tradition and Nostalgia is by no means meant to be our end goal.</p>, <p>Midnight in Paris interested me because on one hand Woody Allen is acting as if he is giving us good advice on this matter. On the other hand, making sure we are stopped in our tracks. This is one of many ways our opposition tries to control us. The film is well done, entertaining, and quite funny. With that being said, Allen wishes to make you feel like you are progressing while in reality keeping you in a perpetual hamster wheel. It is all too Caducean. We need to spot this effect in every aspect of our lives. We need to break free of not only the prison our opposition has created for us but the one that we, as nationalists, construct for ourselves. Move forward. Not backward.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Editor’s Note: This is an excerpt from the author’s forthcoming book “American Extremist: The Psychology of Political Extremism”.

Bond’s <em>‘Nemesis’ </em>and Christopher Caldwell’s <em>‘The Age of Entitlement’</em>, for example) utterly demolish this faulty perception.  Nothing has ever occurred, whether we speak of the American Revolution, the Bolshevik Revolution, Mussolini’s or Napoleon’s rise to power, to use some recent examples, without the patronage of the upper classes.  The extremist capture of the United States is no exception.  Before we may begin, I must credit some of these insights to the work of Polish psychiatrist Andrzej Lobaczewski, who, after collecting several decade’s worth of work studying the psychology of totalitarian regimes (in particular the USSR), published them in 2006 in a book titled <em>‘Political Ponerology: A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes’.</em></p>, <p>In his book, Lobaczewski described a ‘<em>hysteroidal cycle’</em> whereby the privileged classes transmit maladaptive attitudes and behaviors over the course of multiple generations, the final result of which is a phenomenon he termed <em>‘macrosocial dysfunction’</em>.  Put succinctly, the dysfunctions of the few (the privileged classes) become the dysfunctions of the many (everyone else).  These hysteroidal cycles consist of alternating durations of ‘happy times’ and ‘unhappy times’, where, in the former, moral and psychological knowledge pertaining to issues of psychopathology is suppressed, while the latter represents an excavation and exploration of this previously forbidden trove of knowledge.  The subsequent recovery of this knowledge is then used to rectify problems created by the hoarding of this information.</p>, <p>Lobaczewski views social injustice as integral to the perpetuation of mass psychological dis-ease, seeing as, in his view, the upper classes necessarily exploit the lower classes in order to attain (and preserve) their wealth and good fortune (The happiness and prosperity of this first phase of the cycle itself may be predicated on the suppression and persecution of some minority group, or the under classes more broadly).  Through conversive and hysterical reasoning, these privileged classes selectively perceive information in such a way that they can more easily justify profiting from their ill gotten gains and marginalizing the moral, mental, and labor values of those they exploit.  Each subsequent generation suffers from a progressive <em>“atrophy of natural critical faculties”</em> (p. 170) which ultimately culminates in the censorship, persecution, and even genocide of those underprivileged classes, whose very existence challenges the pathological worldview of the privileged.</p>, <p>Control of the psychologically normal is achieved first by the embedding of a <em>“pathologically hypersensitive censor”</em> (p. 177) within the citizenry themselves.  These are in effect, ego defenses deployed by the upper classes who seek to preserve their own positive self-image.  It is these defects of the ego, in the form of <em>“egoism, egotism, and egocentrism” </em>(p. 177) which are the root psychological causes of what he terms <em>characteropathic</em> <em>failings</em>.  Moreover, not only will these privileged classes adopt pathological – and ultimately violent – attitudes toward those they rule, but they will even develop contempt and antagonism toward competing nations that adhere to a healthier and more psychologically integrated approach in their governance.  (We may easily look at the present day United States and see a manifestation of what Lobaczewski describes; the American upper classes regularly castigate their constituents for their moral failings, their lack of sophistication, et cetera, all the while decrying other nations which, however imperfectly they may be achieved, work far more diligently to protect and provide for their people.  Countries such as Hungary, Poland, Russia, Iran, and China come to mind immediately).</p>, <p>In Lobaczewski’s ponerological model, a society is comprised of two essential psychological types: The characteropathic and the normal.  Characteropaths are those individuals who suffer some biological condition (such as brain trauma) or genetic predisposition (for example, a personality disorder) and are thus given to a psychological disposition of evil.  Whether they are the progenitors of such evil or merely the lackeys who happily execute the evil will of others is of little consequence.  We may call these types <em>maladapts.  </em>The ‘normals’ are greater in number than the maladapts, and have an innate moral character in addition to a well-adapted psychological profile, but are often incapable of recognizing (or even properly resisting) this psychology of evil due to their naïve condition.</p>, <p>Any institution can find itself infiltrated by maladapts who then work to bend that institution to their will, which in turn signals a fertile ground for other maladapts and <em>pathocrats</em> to gain entry (pathocrats being defined as any political actor given to a psychology of evil).  It is the nature of the characteropath to exploit structural weaknesses in an organization so that he may overtake it, turning it to his own diabolical purposes.  Should he fail it would be his death; if the characteropath cannot ascend to the role of pathocrat, he would either wash out of society due to his own weakness and lack of social utility or be driven out by those members of polite society who have become wise to his game.  We may say then that subversion and domination are among the defining traits of the characteropath.  They are a biological type who cannot thrive under normal conditions – they must destroy what is good and healthy in order to live.  Fortunately for us, Lobaczewski argues that <em>“the pathocracy’s dominance will weaken imperceptibly but steadily, finally leading to a situation where in the society of normal people reaches for power. This is a nightmare vision to the psychopaths. That the biological, psychological, moral, and economic destruction of the majority of normal people becomes, for the pathocrat, a biological necessity.”</em> (p. 208).  The essential civilizational struggle, in Lobaczewski’s view, lies between ‘the normal people’ and the pathocrats; it is a conflict which has occurred in every civilization for as long as human societies have existed and will persist for as long as our species draws breath.</p>, <p>As I have noted already, Lobaczewski looks to the sciences of biology and genetics to find the origin of the characteropath.  It is of interest to note that Lobaczewski was among the last class of psychiatrists to be trained in these disciplines before the Soviets censored them and restricted the discipline to the study of Pavlovian concepts.  (Here we see a clear bit of historical proof for Lobaczewski’s argument).  While the science of psychopathology has progressed a great deal since Lobaczewki’s time as a student (and there still remains a great deal of disagreement over the proper diagnostic criteria for many of these conditions), I will reproduce his findings as he described them so that the reader may appreciate them in their full and unadulterated context.  Primarily, Lobaczewski connects the biological dimension of the characteropath’s psychopathology to a condition of <em>schizoidia</em>.  The schizoid is recognized by an acute hypersensitivity and characteristic distrustfulness; they are inattentive to the emotions of others, quickly adopt extreme positions, and retaliate harshly (and immediately) for perceived slights against them.  Typically eccentric, they are prone to projecting <em>(“superimposing”</em> in Lobaczewski’s words) <em>“erroneous, pejorative interpretations of other people’s intentions”</em> (p. 123).  In simpler terms, they are quick to malign others without sufficient reason for doing so.  They are drawn to moral causes, although they <em>“actually inflict damage upon themselves and others”</em> (p. 123).  Owing to their impoverished worldview, they are overly pessimistic and misanthropic with regards human nature.  Schizoids have a <em>“dull pallor of emotion”</em> and <em>“consider themselves intellectually superior to ordinary people”</em> (p. 124).  Interestingly, Lobaczewski points out that, demographically speaking, schizoids are represented most numerously among Jews (elsewhere, and repeatedly, Lobaczewski observes the overrepresentation of Jews among these pathocratic types).</p>, <p>However, we should not limit our concern to these dysfunctional individuals alone.  Exposure to these types who exhibit dysfunctional personalities can twist the minds of a normal person, capturing them in the vortex of their mental illness, not unlike a starship caught in the tractor beam of some intergalactic warmonger.  Proximity to characteropaths, then, is as great a risk to the average person as their mere existence is.  The pathocrat is a natural parasite who can only thrive in an environment that is explicitly hostile to the needs and demands of the average person.  As such, characteropaths frantically work to pervert the organizations they join by manipulating and distorting language so as to provide cover for their true intentions.  The characteropath sets himself up as an integral member of the institution, enshrining himself as a necessary priestly type who may then provide the ideological weight for the yet-to-be-adopted belief system.  Where these individuals (to use Lobaczewski’s phrase, <em>“spellbinders”</em>) are unable to directly influence and redirect the energies of a given organization, they will form alliances with more charismatic types who may themselves be less pathological, or simply possess an earthier charm and personal magnetism that allows them to capture the imagination of a people, even without any kind of intellectual or ideological acumen to support his campaign.</p>, <p>Often, these pathocrats are able to attract less dysfunctional types (Lobaczewski calls them <em>“skirtoids”</em>), who dutifully execute their dictates and assist in maintaining the new moral infrastructure.  These skirtoids <em>“are vital, egotistical, and thick-skinned individuals who make good soldiers because of their endurance and psychological resistance.  In peacetime, however, they are incapable of understanding life’s subtler matters or rearing children prudently.  They are happy in primitive surroundings; a comfortable environment easily causes hysterization within them.  They are rigidly conservative in all areas and supportive of governments that rule with a heavy hand.”</em>  (p. 136).  These psychopaths (pathocrats), often being physically incapable of enacting the methods they propagate through oral and written sophistry, are heavily reliant on these skirtoids and a third type, which he calls <em>“jackals”</em>.  These individuals are <em>“hired as professional and mercenary killers by various groups and who so quickly and easily take up arms as a means of political struggle; no human feelings interfere with their nefarious plans.”</em> (p. 136).   But Lobaczewski stops at the point of categorizing these types as fitting within either the skirtoidal or psychopathic dimensions of psychopathology, but rather suggests that <em>“we should assume this type to be a product of a cross between lesser taints of various deviations.”</em> (p. 136). Furthermore, he states <em>“mate-selection psychology produces pairings which bilaterally represent various anomalies.  Carriers of two or even three lesser deviational factors should thus be more frequent.  A jackal could then be imagined as the carrier of schizoidal traits in combination with some other psychopathy, e.g. essential psychopathy or skirtoidism.” </em>(p. 136).</p>, <p>It is critical for these pathocratic spellbinders to nudge the normal majority away from what Lobaczewski calls its <em>“congenital instinctive infrastructure”</em> (p. 60).  He repeatedly emphasizes the necessity for the <em>“common sense”</em> (p. 188) of the normal majority to prevail in order for a society to maintain its moral center and to thrive intellectually, creatively, economically, and spiritually.  To separate the majority from their common sense, the spellbinder employs the use of doubletalk as his chief strategy for nudging people away from their natural instincts.  The process of ponerization (the overcoding of a society’s moral structure from moral to immoral) necessitates a dual semantic layer, wherein the outer layer is used rhetorically against the target while the inner layer reinforces membership among those psychopaths embedded within the power structure.  In effect, these differing meanings serve to re-stratify the classes of a ponerogenic culture.  The spellbinders (and their collaborators) immediately recognize its hermeneutic meaning; it is only after prolonged exposure (and great labor on the part of the masses) that the targets of this ponerogenic speech are ever availed of its true meaning.  To put this in our current context, we may look at certain phrases (e.g., <em>“Diversity is our strength”</em>) and understand how the meaning differs depending on who utters it (diversity may be a strength for the spellbinder, but as Robert Putnam argued in his 2000 publication, “<em>Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community” </em>it proves to be a problem for those outside of the spellbinding class).</p>, <p>I have made this point already but it bears elaboration: Innately these spellbinders are people who cannot function in a healthy society, and moreover, feel wronged by it.  As part of their paranoid ideations, they perceive themselves as marginalized and persecuted (although in a certain sense they are correct, given their predilection for manipulation and harm, the natural response is one of ostracism).  The narcissism and self-absorption of the psychopath leads him to create a kind of hero myth that justifies his own actions (if not to himself than to those he seeks dominion over).  By necessity, the characteropath casts himself as a savior – as one who has graciously taken up the causes of liberation and nobility.  This approach proves advantageous for him if he operates within a society where actual injustice is present and easily identifiable (which is usually the case).  Lobaczewski points out that these types construct ideological unions which are predicated upon 1) the exaltation of a wronged other, 2) the radical redressing of that wrong, and 3) the higher values of the characteropathic individuals who have usurped the organization.</p>, <p>Individual psychological failings (be they psychopaths, or abnormal and deficient in some other way) are then moralized into a revolutionary credo that gives them just cause for retribution, thus providing sufficient motivation to deny any self-examination.  Were this technique not so repugnant, one could admire its ingenuity; the moral wickedness of their conduct (which would surely be apparent to any outsider, were it stripped of its romanticism and paramoralisms) is neatly excused and then expelled.  Such a practice is especially important for counteracting the functional conscience in those with a more typical psychological profile.  The fact that true injustice <em>does</em> exist, and that this new ideology <em>claims to resist it</em> means that inductees into this new culture will be more easily swayed into rationalizing the spellbinder’s doubletalk, and never question its truer esoteric meaning.  Naturally, there is more to this story – and 21<sup>st</sup> century America is very different from the Soviet Republic of the last century.  I will address these differences in a moment.  For now, let us look once more at this phenomenon of spellbinding.</p>, <p>For the skeptical reader, we can dispel with the fanciful terminology and simply look to the very real circumstances we observe in our current situation.  Take the language of victimization and its myriad expressions – racism, sexism, xenophobia, transphobia, homophobia, islamophobia, ableism, to name a few.  Let us begin with the use of the term ‘racism’: Initially, the word was used to describe an irrational and seething hatred of other races.  Those noble of heart and sensitive to the plight of, say, African-Americans, knew in their souls that they did not harbor animosity toward Blacks and therefore willingly acclimated to the changing cultural and political dialectics.  But as per the hermeneutic tradition of the spellbinder, the term came to take on a new meaning – that of power and privilege.  The eternal revolt against racial discrimination required a new meaning for a new time, against a new generation of foes.  Now, to be racist no longer means being an unsophisticated bigot, full of hatred; instead, it means to enjoy the privilege of cultural, historical, and political continuity.  To be a racist in 21<sup>st</sup> century America is to hold power, unearned power, over the dispossessed other.   In one sense, that power is one of an unbroken continuity of being – but in a more immediate and political sense it is about institutional hegemony.  Whites, being privileged, now find themselves swimming in a racist undercurrent, where every action, every errant glance, each thoughtless utterance is actually a demonstration of sinister, unjustifiable power and racial superiority that must be deconstructed.  As the usage of this term and the ability to affect political and cultural change based on the desire to annihilate racism grows, more Americans find themselves scratching their heads at the new power this term wields.  <em>“How is that racist?  That doesn’t make sense.  I don’t hate Blacks or Hispanics.”</em>  And likely they don’t.  Only one no longer has to hate non-Whites in order to be racist, one merely has to <em>exist</em> in order to be racist.  The jargon of pathocratic psychopathy has thus emerged from its cocoon different, changed, and now more powerful than when it first appeared.</p>, <p>Sexism worked in this way too; the willful discrimination and marginalization of women meant something far different a few decades ago.  Whereas any social role that was denied to women was understood to be sexist, now any circumstance which affects women <em>differently </em>is evidence of sexual discrimination and oppression.  With such an elastic definition, instances of racism and sexism now explode with regularity.  Similarly with homophobia, islamophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and the like, the spellbinding hermeneutics of prejudice grant more power to the characteropath and further oppress the normal and the psychologically fit.  Of particular insidiousness is the use of the suffix ‘phobia’; the use of a clearly understood medical and psychiatric terminology, ‘phobia’ has been grafted to a sociopolitical system of linguistics that overcodes an entire range of cognitions and affects, reducing them to a singular phenomena – fear – the use of which now paints anyone who demonstrates anything other than unflinching support (and submission) towards an underprivileged group could be considered fearful, despotic, and mentally ill.</p>, <p>A new meaning for millennia old biological and evolutionary normalcy’s was created to psychologically wound average people who are not nearly as Machiavellian and sinister as those spellbinders responsible for creating this new moral-linguistic landscape.  A whole range of emotional responses (e.g., disgust, confusion, reticence, self-preservation, et cetera) are no longer legitimated for anyone outside of the spellbinding class, and especially for those unwilling to subjugate themselves to it.  It is difficult to overstate the effect this has on the mind – by constantly changing the moral language and rules of social engagement, consciousness is split, and new sub-personalities are created which now exist in a constant state of conflict.  Not only do these terms create a new moral, linguistic, and affective landscape, but they also radically redraw the sociopolitical structure, creating new castes of privileged and unprivileged members, and allotting people to these new classes based on their willingness to conform to an ever-changing set of demands.</p>, <p>Another example would be the constantly evolving charge of anti-Semitism.  Clearly, it was once understood that claims of anti-Semitism were intended to characterize attitudes and conduct that were explicitly (and perhaps even implicitly) discriminatory or hostile toward Jewish people.  Presently, (and much like the plastic definition of racism) it is now used to designate <em>any</em> othering of Jews, be it negative or positive.  And so, folded into the original meaning of these terms (hatred and fear) is any impulse toward differentiation (another ‘common sense’ instinct as Lobaczewski would say).  Interestingly, the very use of the term is curious because it creates a cleavage in the Gentiles understanding of who precisely <em>is</em> a Semite.  Anti-Semitism is fundamentally about anti-Jewish sentiment, but the term Semite is a cultural, linguistic, ethnic, and racial designation that encompasses a far broader grouping of peoples than simply that of the Jewish individual.  Once more we see how spellbinders use language to fracture and limit the cognitive abilities of the average person.</p>, <p>The originators of these spells create the circumstances by which a healthy society is carved up under the new rules of engagement.  But as I have already pointed out, their progeny merely inherit this system of rules and logic, often without any insight into its genesis.  This phenomenon is not unlike the transmission of rituals and taboos, whereby people unthinkingly inherit these dictums but are oblivious to their intention, and so merely act on them in rote, unconscious fashion.  This is how psychopathic tendencies are transmitted intergenerationally – at first as an intentional means of control, and then merely as a commonplace and thoughtless habit, not unlike how one washes up after themselves.  The situation becomes far worse for the inheritors of this system, as they merely acquire these attitudes through the mechanisms of conditioning and modeling.  They are indoctrinated into a pathological worldview which dictates every relationship they enter, every career they take up, each choice and each breath.  Children don’t just inherit the material or biological traits of their parents, but also their ideological ones (particularly the farther one goes up the socioeconomic ladder, where the stakes are higher).  Of course, these conditions are guaranteed to degenerate over time, as the inheritors of this system possess none of the insight, none of the self-awareness of their forbears, and are subsequently left with fewer psychological tools with which to manage themselves or their pathological reactions.  While they may acquire their power second-hand, it comes with a litany of irrational and hysterical impulses which can neither be contextualized nor dissipated.  Heavy indeed is the head that wears the crown.  Naturally psychopaths wound themselves with their psychological contortions, ego defenses, and general anti-social conduct.  We understand very easily as well that they wound those who are made the targets of their pathology.  But what is less well understood is how those around them, their wives, husbands, children, nieces and nephews, too, are victimized by their pathological and misanthropic outlook.  Their impoverished psychological worldview becomes a mental prison that their kin rarely, if ever, escapes.  Worse still, those that do escape become permanent outcasts, as they – not unlike cult members – have broken out of an inter-generational cycle of psychopathy only to find little in the way of community outside of it.  However, it should be said that they often end up worse than cult members.  In many cases, these individuals lose affiliations of race, religion, social class, and more personally, blood relations.  It is difficult to quantify just which is worse for such individuals – the spellbinding that keeps them in a state of conformity or the ostracism they suffer as a result of breaking free.  Each outcome is tragic in its own way.</p>, <p>It is not uncommon to come across people (even in the online dissident sphere) who believe that the upper classes are made up of individuals with relatively typical psychological profiles.  This is not to say that they are <em>just like us, </em>but it is a kind of reflexive unwillingness to entertain the possibility – neigh, the existence – of evil.  Such individuals may rationalize away the failures of leadership or even identify with their plight.  There are some who believe in the existence of a <em>One Weird Trick For Solving Political Strife</em>, whereby all that is required to solve the problems confronting the over-class is to provide them with a better system or a better deal.  I cannot in good conscience endorse this worldview.  We simply know too much about the nature of the psychopathy and its prevalence among the leadership classes (Robert Hare and Hervey Cleckley have both written extensively on the over-representation of psychopathy among corporate and political leadership).  All of this is not to say that every leader is a dastardly, mustache-twirling loon, or even that every psychopath presents a clear and present danger to the social order (psychopathy is defined by a variety of traits, and it is not necessarily the case that the psychopath is malevolent; often they merely lack that positive social feeling more commonly found among the normal population), but what I am saying is that these individuals are not, by and large, a class to be reasoned with.  A sober analysis (such as the one I have provided) puts us in a superior position to organize and develop effective strategies for advancing <em>our </em>political aims, and not the aims of those who view us with contempt.</p>, <p>Andrzej Łobaczewski, Political Ponerology: A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes, (Grande Prairie: Red Pill

Prior to 2020, he was known near exclusively by a sole biography on Francis Parker Yockey, <em>Dreamer of the Day</em>, and any conspiracy of the following sort would have been considered gauche.  Almost immediately after his passing The New York Times released a laudatory obituary of the man.  Their hosting memoirs from figures like Uma Zykofsky<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> – a Deputy Director for the State of California<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> – shows that we can only imagine the journalist’s shadow activities.</p>, <p>Of course the rabbit hole goes further than high-ranking civil servants; ‘The Unrepentant Marxist’, a communist blog presenting itself as an obscure underdog yet somehow racking up six million views, exploded with activity following the death.  The blog’s author Louis Proyect has dedicated an article to the Irishman’s activism, crediting his friendship with Noel Ignatiev and Kevin to his time in the neo-trotskyite movement, likening the trio to red ‘vanguard’ soldiers<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> (yes – <em>the department head of Harvard University, Ignatiev</em>).  It would be a claudicate task to have fabricated such articles, in short order, and following a death which most of his readership are still completely unaware of.  Likewise, there has been a simultaneous outpouring of data on other websites within the span of several days with their own regales of Kevin.  Could it be that these surface level outré blogs are merely a cover for a ring of neo-marxists?  Color me shocked.</p>, <p>It appears that before writing his 2019 hit-piece on Arktos media ‘Lost Imperium’, the self-avowed journalist had been racking up quite the portfolio of work.  Although <em>Dreamer of The Day </em>includes passing mention of Coogan’s work with journals such as <em>Mother Jones</em><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> (surprisingly, a co-author of perhaps their most infamous issue on white-nationalism, see ‘Europe’s New Fascists’),<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> it was not until a month ago that a complete list of his works was released.  Just as suspicious as the geocities websites and underground blogs one must navigate in order to make sense of this prolific author’s work, there is far more than initially meets the eye.  ‘Beyond The Fringe Politics’ lists 34 works that were either independently pursued or co-authored in his free time, most of which are anti-rightist and suggestively intelligence based.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>  Much how the UK magazine titled <em>Lobster</em>, which hosted Coogan’s work twenty years prior to his latest attack, is under a buried geocities style webpage described as a ‘journal of parapolitics, intelligence and state research’.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>, <p>So what are we to make of Coogan’s recently veiled attack (if we are to borrow a phrase of his)<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> on Bolton? It appears that just as much camouflage was employed in the Irishman’s personal life as in his faux objective reporting; <em>Dreamer of the Day</em> being popularized within the communities he investigated for the ADL and SPLC.  Irrespective to whether or not this was intentional, it would come as no surprise that such documentary and commercial hype was an asset for like organizations.  As we will come to expose, Coogan continued affiliation with multiple left-hand-path groups which he attempted to dissociate himself with for professional reasons – on the surface, ostensibly ‘journalism’, which was a cover for perhaps his own homebrewed espionage.  Without a doubt, he had made himself familiar with <em>Fascist Odyssey </em>and had been following Bolton and Arktos for years in the shadows.</p>, <p>In fact, it was about twenty years prior when he published his initial attack on the Kiwi; the final Appendix of Yockey’s initial biography titled, ‘Francis Parker Yockey and the Devil’, attempts to associate itself with pop-occult figures such as Varg Vikernes and Michael Moynihan,<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> in what appears to be a smoke screen for its greater vitriol toward Kerry Bolton.  Such attempts to sway the reader’s attention to Moynihan’s affiliation with the Church of Satan, tandem the near farcical threat of ‘Black Nazi Metal’ rock bands, are suspect; Coogan himself had maintained contact with many off-color groups during his work with the ADL, including the rings of satanism.  With his passing it is now widely available that the Irishman claimed to have been abused as a youth in the cult of Lyndon LaRouche, head of the NCLC (National Caucus of Labor Committees), of which The New York Times obituary attests Coogan’s membership of.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>  Proyect’s memorial of the biographer also claims that by happenstance he was an abuse victim of the cult as well, and that they managed to stumble upon one another via blog comments.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>, <p>An awfully convenient circumstance., given that Proyect claims his work of LaRouche was intended to be performed marxist qua marxist until Coogan contacted him anonymously to suggest otherwise.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>  Irrespective to his appearance as capable viz. an association with Noel Ignatiev, said testimony gives an appearance of the tail wagging the dog. According to Proyect, Coogan had pseudonymously nudged him with a hundred plus comments on his cult articles until revealing his true name – claiming that he had been using a handle to protect himself from LaRouche’s goons.  Begging the question as to why, if such a group was a reckoned power decades past, that the Irishman used his real name in 1999 only to change so in 2017?</p>, <p>Given that both men set out to publish joint works on LaRouche following their acquaintance, now claiming the cult leader should be rebranded as an ‘American fascist’, we can substantiate that ‘The Unrepentant Marxist’ is not simply a cut-out job to discredit Coogan.  Of course, The New York Times obituary asserts that the journalist was interested in far-left causes during his youth, and it appears that in circles outside of ‘The Unrepentant Marxist’ he maintained the alibi as being coaxed into abuse.  However, he admits on Proyect’s website that he infiltrated the LaRouche cult <em>intentionally</em> under the auspice of holding marxian views.  Stating, “I told them that I was in Columbia SDS in the sixties and used to go to his lectures – a total lie.  I also told them that I read ‘Dialectical Economics: An Introduction to Marxist Political Economy’, which was only a [an additional] white lie…”<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>  More than several articles compiling an analysis of the cult were under his pseudonymous authorship, and only revealed until after his death according to the trotskyite editor (now running cover for his online buddy).</p>, <p>Appearing on the surface as a kind of self-aggrandizing attempt to imitate the espionage of his fascist competitors, though, this brings a whole new light to the journalist’s life.  Following the distribution of Bolton’s work as a counter to the anti-fascist, a slew of critical insider reviews surfaced.  Two of those critical on <em>Dreamer</em> authored by self-proclaimed [unwitting] informants to Coogan (one now redacted).<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>  If it were not for the SPLC and ADL substantiating claims that the Irishman had cooperated with them, and a simultaneous leak of correspondence proving his connection with Adam Parfrey, I would have not included mention of the following (now redacted) Amazon review: it appears that one of the sources for his biography had accused the journalist of working with David Horowitz, the ADL, and plagiarizing much of Parfrey’s work on researching Yockey (which was allegedly compiled over a lengthy period of time by the anarcho-satanist crowd after Yockey’s death in 1960).</p>, <p>This would explain the immense citations by Coogan which have long been the source of twisted faces attempting to reason how one man could be so voluminous.  Many of which would have required travel to exotic countries, tracking down personal contacts of Yockey which are either impossible to find or dead.  As asserted in the article ‘Lost Imperium’, the journalist continues to credit himself as the originator.  Of course, his later mention of meeting Huxley-Blythe after the work was published<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> begs questions as to how he would pull off meeting a fascist after exposing himself as an ADL crony who manipulated Willis Carto and H. Keith Thompson’s inner circle, likewise, maintaining friendships with conflicting occult groups worldwide seen as international terrorists.  Something smells awry.</p>, <p>A light bulb went off in my head when reading the now redacted testimony – <em>Dreamer </em>mentions Adam Parfrey in passing, after attempting to affiliate him with the Church of Satan and fascist movements as a snide dismissal.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>  In anachronistic fashion, the work’s extensive name-dropping which limited the author from listing all discussed figures in its index just so happens to relegate a space for Parfrey.  Out of the hundreds of names which may have drawn attention, Coogan allows a modest corner in the glossary of his text.  It is interesting, then, that a significant portion of his breath was spent claiming throughout the biography that movements like American anarchy and satanism began archiving Yockey’s work<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> – at one point suggesting a connection between Keith Stimely and Feral House.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>  Of course, these anonymous parties were never given joint credit in researching the text.</p>, <p>Counter-Currents Publishing (which has come to the defense of Bolton’s works) hosted a memorial to Adam Parfrey following his death.  The vigil’s author <em>Margot</em> (same as the unwitting informant) asserts that Adam was, in fact, a satanist.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>  But my concern is more than throwing about quips on one’s risqué faith; we can now uncover a nexus between the anarcho-satanist publisher Feral House (Parfrey’s), Autonomedia (anarcho-marxist publisher of <em>Dreamer</em>), Coogan’s attempts to dissociate from the occult vis-à-vis LaRouche, and the many red-herrings of his text claiming a vanilla lifestyle.  Much how his surface level anti-bolshevism in <em>Dreamer</em> and ‘Lost Imperium’ are exposed as phony upon Proyect’s testimony, the same goes for his attempts to slash and burn affiliations with prior circles he investigated.</p>, <p>It appears that the pseudonymous informant of ‘Margot’ – whose review has not yet been redacted – is also behind the blog ‘Margot Metroland’ documenting Adam Parfrey’s life (mirrored by Counter-Currents).  Through ‘Remembering Adam Parfrey’, we finally get a written testimony mirrored on two sites by an author under the same handle, stating that Coogan was given the information to compile Yockey’s biography.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>  We can confidently assume this is the same figure: the East Coast flagship partner of Counter-Currents which Antifa went through many gyrations to find.  Meaning that, if the Celt had been surveilling her in the nineties, long before the journal’s existence, he was in deep.</p>, <p>The informant’s redacted testimony on Coogan also claims that he maintained contact with the Horowitz family.  Specifically David Horowitz, the Jewish radio show host who has waffled between pro and anti-Israeli conspiracy theories over the years in similar fashion to the froth drummed up by Turning Point USA.  Which is fascinating for that following the death of Adam Parfrey, an anarcho-satanist figure ‘<em>Mitch Horowitz</em>’, performed an interview celebrating the life of his satanist peer.  See, ‘Mitch Horowitz on the Power of Positive (and Satanic) Thinking’.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>  As we display in a later source, private emails between a head author of Feral House to Coogan prove that Dave Horowitz <em>had</em> taken a liking to the Celt.  In fact, Dave Emory appears to have spoken on radio shows within the same circle as Horowitz to puff up Coogan’s theory about red-Nazis.  Specifically a show going by the name ‘Something’s Happening’, in which Parfrey’s research was overlooked to discuss more derisory theories about the Bush family as Marxian red-fascists.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></p>, <p>As if center-politic did not already dismiss Jewish fealty as a contrived rouse!  Let me guess – the secret is they are actually alien-lizard fascists pretending to be Jews in order to run cover for ‘Q’?  Ah, that makes much more sense than financial elite!  In all seriousness, there is an eerie similarity between Emory’s Bush shenanigans and those of Coogan on LaRouche; in another ‘Unrepentant Marxist’ publication, ‘Lyndon LaRouche (1922-2019): a political assessment’, he attempts to implicate Roger Stone and Trump in the occult.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>  Although there may be a relation between <em>Occidental Dissent</em>’s recent expose on Stone’s ties to Weev (suspected quadruple-agent-double-0-Yid, Alan Auernheimer),<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a> this is a far cry from such parallelomania.  Even hosting a website, ‘LaRouche Planet’, where it is argued that the man was weaving layered false dilemma conspiracies about 9/11 as cover for the Saudi’s (the <em>legitimate</em> attackers he purports the Frenchman is aligned with).<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>  Is your head spinning yet?</p>, <p>We may also substantiate leaked emails documented on Wiki’s ‘Talk:Feral House’ and Mail-Archive, that there had been a dispute between Kevin and Adam.  The journalist now using a non-sequitur to accuse Feral House of being pro-Nazi for its satanic bent.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>  If anything, this appears to be a flailing attempt by Coogan to cut ties with a former asset.  Is he schizophrenic, manipulative, or a self-aggrandizing journalist?  At this point God only knows but we can infer that Uma Zykofsky’s (State Deputy Director) glowing words on his amicable nature overlook a much darker side.  By way of combing through the email chain of Feral House author Alex Constantine (attacked by a Coogan supporter and Wiki contributor looking to antagonize his defensive position), we see that Coogan and Parfrey had collaborated on other works in partnership:<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a> specifically, <em>Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism</em>, as well as <em>Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity</em>.  In <em>Black Sun</em>, Goodricke (who wrote the forward to Coogan’s <em>Dreamer</em>) cites Moynihan’s response to the Irishman’s inflammatory attacks.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>  It is tremendously important to note, then, that the sole message which Wikipedia chose to redact was the one they acknowledge as unequivocally noting Coogan’s thievery.  We have been able to retrieve the email transcript from Mail-Archive, signed ‘AC’ [Alex Constantine].  Constantine verbatim accuses Kevin Coogan of plagiarism in a ‘cc’ message to Dave Emory.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></p>, <p>Likewise, Emory, the journalist partially responsible for the promotion of <em>Dreamer</em> (implicated in the argument between Constantine and the anonymous Wiki author, Proyect’s documentation of obscure ties between Coogan and anarchist publications viz. Emory’s introducing him through additional puff-jobs in the Anarchist <em>Maximum Rock</em> magazine)<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a> leaves his condolences for The New York Times obituary among other international names.  “It was my privilege and pleasure to have interviewed Kevin on many occasions…”<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>  Again – could it be that many superficial activist and outré circles are merely cut-outs for intelligence research?  I rest my case.</p>, <p>His appendix is just as dismissive as his latter essay ‘Lost Imperium? Yockey: 20 Years Later’.  “A small trove of writings by Yockey recently surfaced halfway around the world… in a pamphlet entitled <em>Varange</em>… by Kerry Bolton, a New Zealand-based rightist and self-proclaimed Satanist.”<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>  Later writing that the Kiwi’s focus on James Madole – a mainstay whipping boy of Coogan’s biography – is deserving of condemnation.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a>  It may appear intentioned on the surface, but given the Irishman’s approach to besmirching a competing biography, often on the basis of its sheer presence interrupting his own limelight, such claims must be questioned.  Of course, given the leaked information on Coogan’s affiliation with Noel Ignatiev, and his choosing the self-titled ‘anarchist post-structuralist’ publishing house dawning a Marxist red star to distribute his work, methinks this ‘investigative journalist’ was more ideologue than literary servant.</p>, <p>Shortly before Kevin’s death, ‘Lost Imperium’ brought much more evidence to the fore of his suspect activities.  It seems that the major purpose of the article was to be a hit-piece, but why in <em>Lobster Magazine</em>?  One can only imagine that if it were his intention to bring such inflammatory disputes public, he would have performed such beyond the confines of a buried geocities website dedicated to ‘parapolitical intelligence research’.  Though, it is not my intention here to claim we wholly know the motives behind its chief editor, Robin Ramsay, who is the figure responsible for deeming the journal’s purpose as ‘state research’.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>  We can say, however, that there is a consistent thread to their interests; much of his earlier work has been on promoting the UK’s now far-left Labour Party, under the auspice of warning against their swing to extremism as a bad PR move.  See <em>The Rise of New Labour </em>and <em>Smear! Wilson and the Secret State</em>.<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>  It makes sense, then, that they would have endorsed <em>Dreamer of the Day</em>’s mission to paint the red-scare as an American-fascist operation (see the ‘red swastika’ on the cover, which is a chapter title within and also a favorite saying of the author).</p>, <p>Coogan’s main gripe, which <em>Lobster</em> endorses in Issue 78, is that Bolton disrupted his own monolithic presence as the sole biographer on Yockey.  See, “Bolton’s need to cast Yockey in the best possible light makes his <em>Yockey</em> needlessly dull at times… it is first worth noting that there are no breathtaking surprises in Bolton’s study for readers of <em>Dreamer.</em>”<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>  Often sinking to the level of trite quips to discredit the Kiwi – in response to his competitor retrieving further documentation on the fascist spy from Willis Carto he writes, “It is possible that Carto’s archive might hold a historical nugget or two.  However when I interviewed Carto – and in the two decades that followed <em>Dreamer</em> – he had every opportunity to contribute new revelations about Yockey but failed to do so.”<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a>  Further, “Large sections of <em>Yockey: A Fascist Odyssey</em> can even be read as a series of extended footnotes to my <em>Dreamer of the Day.</em>”<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a></p>, <p>The Irishman’s accusation of a failed competitor are reflective of his own inability.  If he truly were the man who compiled decades’ worth of research, would he not be content with Bolton’s surfacing of new data on Yockey?  This is downplayed in his analysis of the text; “Bolton also remains as mystified as I… Nor can Bolton make sense…”<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a>  Perhaps there still exist hard boiled mysteries to Yockey’s life.  As in the case of ‘Alexander Scharf’ – the ostensibly Jewish double-agent whose intentions for the lawyer are still unclear.  But Coogan’s remarks are unwarranted, so much as Bolton clarifies spots where his haphazardness falls short.  I.e., <em>Dreamer</em>’s claims that there was no way of substantiating where William Wernecke’s conflict with the Coyne family (tandem Alice Yockey) originated were recently clarified by the Ernie Lazar FBI files.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a>  Equally, Coogan’s attempts to substantiate claims of his subject being born of a different father (and a crypto Jew at that!)<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a> were refuted by Margot.<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a></p>, <p>Another strange coincidence worth noting is the attempt to associate Keith Stimely with Feral House.  By way of Alex Constantine’s private conversation, we can see that Coogan discredited his peer via Emory’s appearance on ‘Something’s Happening’.<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a>  Why would he do this?  <em>Dreamer</em> seems to emphasize the parallel researcher’s existence on the opposite coast of the country (perhaps as alibi),<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a> but alas, there is a catch.  Feral House was on the West Coast with Coogan during his biographical work, likewise, Autonomedia operates out of Brooklyn, and Coogan had claimed to have traveled all over Europe tracing down political war criminals in hiding.  So he was the true itinerant.</p>, <p>Their simultaneous discovery of watershed FBI files is portrayed simply as a miracle.  Of course, he dismisses any work the peer may have accomplished, “As far as I can determine, he [Keith] never wrote a single page of his proposed Yockey biography.”<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a>  One thing is for certain: speaking for the dead is far easier than the living.  Alex Constantine put up a fight for his publisher’s reputation given that his party was still breathing.  It appears that the attempt to play off any affiliation with Stimely was executed when Parfrey’s crew was hot on Coogan’s tail.  Given Stimely’s affiliation with Yockey’s closest friends, many of whom were the same international figures cited in <em>Dreamer</em>, and the off-handedness with which the Celt includes Thompson and sundry in the Feral House patois to avoid peer-credits, perhaps there was at least ‘a single page’.  If Coogan allegedly accessed the FBI files at the same time as Keith in the eighties, with Margot being surveilled in the mid-nineties, we find a much different picture than an ad hoc researcher whipping 700 pages out of thin air.</p>, <p>If anything, the manic flailing of this ‘journalist’ should not be interpreted as a series of disjunctive breakdowns.  Why the connection to California’s State Department, grooming of Proyect’s Trotskyite circle, clandestine research propping up Anarchist journals, friendships with Harvard department heads, ‘intelligence research’, and the astroturfing of mania around Nazi-Satanist shock-jock?  Narcissism driving authors into loose cannon profligacy is nothing new, but Coogan was no amateur.  His work remains well documented on the SPLC website,<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a> and his cooperation with the ADL and FBI on <em>Dreamer</em> is telling.  Even more so are his attempts to inveigle Bolton – one minute claiming that his competitor’s writing hosts a foul ‘stench’,<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a> the next attempting to flatter by way of supporting the religious theories of Yockey’s past, then claiming that Yockey’s legacy was tarnished by Bolton’s unnecessary affiliating of the spy with anti-Semitism.<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a>  These are merely slash and burn tactics; Coogan’s closing of ‘Lost Imperium’, claiming that Bolton is a Russian-Commie apologist while simultaneously propping up crypto-Marxist groups via Ignatiev, are perfectly mirrored to his circular accusations of LaRouche and Parfrey.</p>, <p>Irrespective to whether Coogan was mistreated by LaRouche, he infiltrated the organization by way of lying; Parfrey and Sundry appear to have been charmed by the man early on, only later to be discarded; ‘Margot’ attests to the fact that Coogan presented himself dishonestly when courting Yockey’s remaining contacts, only later to create a far-Left interpretation of the lawyer; Proyect found himself in cahoots with the alleged Bolshevist author, then later having his work directed into a patchwork theory wherein LaRouche was deemed a fascist; finally, the consummate work of the journalist’s latter years intended to follow up to <em>Dreamer</em> (a multi-volume tome on Marx) has been left in the hands of Proyect as the Irishman’s final wish to paint Marx as a quasi-fascist.<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a>  If I may paraphrase a man of greater poetic ability, the use of artifice inevitably leads to one’s downfall… “It almost always happens that he who uses it to cover one spot uncovers himself in another.”<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a></p>, <p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Uma Zykofsky et al., ‘Kevin J.

She is thus expressing anxiety…</p>, <p>When “Karen” asks to speak to your manager, she is really lashing out at the declining standards of decency, respect, and politeness in multicultural society. She is thus expressing anxiety over is her inability to escape from manifestations of liberalism in decline. “Karen moments” ought to be understood as microcosms of psychological White Flight. They represent the petty refusal of the White woman to accept the consequences of a bargain that she consciously made.</p>, <p>As racialists and Third Positionists, we understand that different races are, on aggregate, not adapted nor capable of adapting to living alongside each other and by each other’s cultural standards within a pluralist assimilation. Time and again, we demonstrate that such arrangements are not sustainable and lead to unhappiness and the degeneration of the entire society. A racialist is therefore <em>more</em>—not less—inclined towards true empathy and understanding when non-Whites fail to conform to the cultural standards of White society, just as a racialist understands why a White person may be incapable of conforming to the cultural standards of any non-White society. Consequently, somebody who has fully internalized their racialism is <em>less</em> likely to lash out or experience a “Karen moment” than somebody who has been deracinated and atomized by their own liberal ontology.</p>, <p>What is a Karen then? A Karen is just a female “racist liberal.”</p>, <p>The particular manifestation of liberalism in decline that the Karen takes offense at is the inability of the non-White to live up to what used to be the cultural norm of liberal society back when it was demographically White. The Karen chastises the non-White effectively for their being insufficiently liberal, and in doing so, exposes both her own latent racial anxieties as well as her unwavering loyalty towards the liberal system. In truth, however, it is the Karen herself who is failing to adapt to the ever-changing cultural standards of liberalism. It is the behavior of the non-White that represents the new cultural norm—ascendant, empowered and favored by the current liberal system, much to Karen’s detriment.</p>, <p>Just as the male racist liberal lashes out in desperation for liberal society to revert to its “1950s” iteration when the White man still reigned supreme, the lashing out of the Karen represents her desperation for liberal society to reverse a transformation that she has only just begun to feel. In other words, the emergence of the Karen meme represents liberal society having surpassed peak White woman. Having spent the last 120 years gradually empowering themselves at the expense of social cohesion, sacrificing their most sacred roles as mothers and wives in exchange for a chance to climb the social ladder alone and atomized, White women are now in a state of decline. Just as liberalism betrayed White men, it has now begun to betray White women, just as it will inevitably betray the non-White coalition that it will elevate next, and so on.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3147" height="295" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/karen-memes-10-300x295.png" width="300"/></p>, <p>White men have already been feeling liberalism’s cold shoulder for a long time, and so among many men, the Karen meme invokes sentiments of <em>Schadenfreude</em>— Karens everywhere are finally getting their just comeuppance! Not exactly an admirable or noble attitude towards our sisters, but understandable, especially given how eager White women were to twist the knife and express those same sentiments towards White men during our decline.</p>, <p>In the end, however, both White men and women made the same bargain with liberalism, trading our own atomization in exchange for material gains that were short-lived and ever fleeting from the get-go. We ought not to resent each other for this decision; however, we also ought not to play the victim, nor indulge each other’s delusions of victimhood. This was the future we chose. Every day of our lives, we made the conscious decision to remain atomized and deracinated and to buy into that system. Our inability to escape from these consequences is something that we must come to terms with, despite how terrifying it may be.</p>, <p>To a certain extent, we are all of us creatures of liberalism. Centuries of its dysgenic influence have changed us deeply. No amount of mollycoddling, wishful thinking, or even direct manipulation of demographics—something we collectively lack the power and will to do, anyway—is going to undo those changes. Only a revolution of our societal structure and institutions reflecting Third Position philosophy will allow us to begin the process of reversing the degeneracy of liberalism.</p>, <p>In strategizing over how to best ensure said revolution, I’ve seen many of my comrades discussing what ought to be our response to the Karen Question. To this I answer the following:</p>, <p>Should we sympathize with the Karens? Not exactly.</p>, <p>Should we reach out to the Karens? Yes, but not unconditionally.</p>, <p>As a movement, we must have standards, and we must enforce those standards universally, both inside our ranks and outside. The purpose of Third Position thinking has never been to cuddle people who remain fundamentally loyal towards liberalism. We are not here to provide people with a “safe space” to vent their racial anxieties and frustrations, while they continue to live their day-to-day lives within an ontologically liberal framework. We must constantly be <em>challenging</em> others to reject liberalism and <em>challenging</em> them to join us, if they dare, just as we must constantly be <em>challenging</em> ourselves to live and die by our own beliefs.</p>, <p>Over and over again, our impulse is to invite the “battered wives” of liberalism into our ranks, while turning a blind eye towards all the glaring signs and red flags that they remain hopeful that their abuser can be reformed and redeemed. We need to stop doing this. We must start thinking of our racial brethren as though they were drug-addicted junkies (their drug of choice: liberalism), and adjust our outreach tactics accordingly. Naturally, this applies to both men and women. We’ve had over four years to observe and reflect upon the consequences of the Alt-Right having “red-pilled” legions of cretinous racist liberals, who remain a burden on us to this day. We’ve still yet to learn from these mistakes.</p>, <p>Until they demonstrate commitment to Third Position beliefs, we should allow the system to attack these people with every weapon it has, to psychologically break them. Only then should we offer them our hand, so that we may then rebuild them by our own will, and if they still refuse our hand, then we have only to withdraw it and allow the system to attack further. The Karen meme itself is absolutely an invention of our enemies, it is absolutely anti-White, and it is used by our enemies to attack racist liberals. Good. Let them have at it. Let the racist liberals be broken again and again until they beg for our embrace.</p>, <p>We can have a certain sympathy for Karens and the dilemma they find themselves in . . . but they are not comrades, and they likely never will be. Indeed, they will likely never extract themselves from the spider’s web they’re caught in. They’ll probably never even want to.</p>, <p>We have become used to living under pax Americana that our analysis of almost all situations presupposes its continued existence, ironically even when such analysis calls for a new world…</p>, <p>We have become used to living under pax Americana that our analysis of almost all situations presupposes its continued existence, ironically even when such analysis calls for a new world order. Take as an example the proponents of ethnonationalism, in its most universalistic form, they demand that all peoples who aspire to a state of their own should be given one. Ethnonationalists argue this will prevent conflict by removing internal divisions over race and even ethnicity, to as large of a degree as possible. Furthermore, neighbouring countries will have fewer reasons to enter into conflicts, with their respective countrymen all being contained within a single state. We will have our little Flanders, little Scotland, and little Catalonia peacefully trading for their natural resources, following a global non-aggression principle. In their view there is no need for a united European state. These little statelets will form a defensive alliance that some ethnonationalists believe will be strong enough to prevent invasions from extra-European powers. But, anyone examining the historical record should find this ideology suspect. The entente powers split apart their opponents into relatively close approximations of ethnostates, compared to what came before. The fact that the greatest war in history came after this does not seem to bide well with the petty nationalist vision, perhaps real ethnonationalism has never been tried. They would reiterate that Germany started WW2 as a response to the dismemberment of their country, they would not be completely wrong. But, petty nationalists have no solution for the multiple other causes of conflict between states: to create defensible borders, to secure resources, secure captive export markets, build foreign military bases that can be used to project power, and in general to enlarge their spheres of influence. They handwave these aspects of foreign policy away, in the European context, with rather utopian sentiments of our common European brotherhood felt by today’s European nationalists, as if the feelings of people outside the halls of power will stay the same if they enter them. According to them trade will proceed as it does now, with or without the American empire; to say otherwise is to admit to chinks in their petty nationalist armour. Empire is unnecessary, “look today you can buy bananas in Moscow all the way from Central America”; what they forget is that the American post-WW2 system makes most of this unprotected global trade possible. The world that the petty nationalist desires, in fact, requires the existence of the American Empire.</p>, <p>Before we start discussing the faults with petty nationalism, it is important to discuss the unprecedented effect the American Empire has had on global trade. The importance of American naval supremacy cannot be overestimated. Prior to 1945 most trade was conducted within an imperial trading block or with immediate neighbours. As ocean going trade required a large navy to convoy ships to their ports of call, this was the primary role of the Royal Navy throughout most of its history. Since European powers might be involved in conflicts with each other, trade outside of your sphere of influence was quite risky since these imports would cease during war. Trading overseas was even more risky. The American system forced states within their Atlanticist sphere to decolonize, replacing the imperial trading block, where colonial powers extracted primary resources from colonies and used them as captive export markets, with the system of global and relatively free trade. Colonies once restricted to trading with their overlord now could trade with any nation and importantly, they were now open to American corporations.</p>, <p>There was a pax Britannica preceding the American order and global trade under this order grew to a degree, but this growth pales in comparison to the huge increases in trade post-1945. The growth of globalization has been a manifestation of the politics of the American order, rather than an emergent trend resulting from economics and technological progress. The United States created their order as a way of securing alliances against the threat of the Soviet Union. The huge American market was opened to their European and East Asian allies, allowing those states to trade their way back to prosperity. The United States cracked open the colonial world allowing both the victors and defeated powers of WW2 access to any natural resources they required, without military expansion or colonial holdings. The United States navy, virtually unchallenged globally, was committed to the freedom of the navigation, preventing any disruption of global sea trade. Subsequently, the price of shipping decreased drastically allowing supply chains that once were dispersed throughout a single country now to be dispersed throughout the world creating the global economy we have today.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3136">Pax Americana</p>, <p>After the fall of the USSR, the United States opened this global system to practically the entire world. This brought on the biggest artificial boom in history; states that have never been wealthy in their existence can now use trade to offset serious geographic weaknesses. This has allowed global populations in agriculturally poor states, such as those in Africa and the Middle East, to explode. China and to a lesser extent India have seen a massive growth in GDP. China has progressively climbed the value-added ladder, making their economy more and more advanced all in thanks to trade with the United States. But, the underlying reason the United States created this system was not to promote order and prosperity in the 3rd world but to contain and defeat the Soviet Union. American cold war policy sought to prevent the formation of a Eurasian hegemon, which would have controlled most of the world’s oil, resources, and population. The fall of the Soviet Union undermines the American order’s reason for its own existence and has become a serious conundrum to the global order, one that has been only exacerbated by President Trump. Namely this order was created primarily for political reasons not economic ones, the economic growth was only a by-product. The reality of the demise of the USSR has finally caught up with the United States, they are asking themselves the questions of why they should support trade deals designed to buy alliances. Deals that usually were at the expense of American industry for a war that is over, why should they underwrite the defence of the NATO? This trend of shirking away from their position as leaders of the global order is only being accelerated by the shale revolution, which has now made the United States a net exporter of oil. The United States has few economic incentives to continue the global order; those who argue the United States should pay for global stability seem to be losing the debate. In fact, the American economy is the least dependent on foreign trade amongst all the major powers; this is even more apparent when you consider the largest sources of American trade is to its neighbors: Mexico and Canada. Therefore, little by little, the American order will retreat to North America, and likely continue to support a few key partners such as Britain and Australia.</p>, <p>Eventually, some crisis will force a state’s hand to attack a rival’s shipping, perhaps to interdict oil shipments back home. If the United States doesn’t respond this will trigger a slow return to the old norm of naval power determining the reach of a countries merchant marine. As an aside, this could be triggered by an East-Asian tanker war over diminished gulf oil exports due to a direct Saudi Arabian-Iran military conflict disrupting production. The future order the petty nationalists require may cease to exist in the coming decade. The small states of Europe will find themselves in a very different world where your next shipment of oil is no longer guaranteed, and your exports could have no buyer. Let us then return to analyzing the claims of the petty nationalists in regard to the future of Europe.</p>, <p>The internal cohesion of Europe is waved aside as a non-issue since most of today’s nationalists are united by the common crisis that is affecting every European ethnicity. Is that the proper basis from which a European order can be created? <u>Greg Johnson</u> outlines the petty nationalist position on minimizing intra-European crisis:</p>, <p><em>As for white fratricide: the best way to defuse white ethnic conflicts is not to combat “petty” nationalism but to take it to its logical conclusion. If different ethnic groups yoked to the same system are growing restive, then they should be allowed to go their own ways. Through moving borders and moving peoples, homogeneous ethnostates can be created, in which each self-conscious people can speak its own language and practice its own customs free from outside interference. Such a process could be mediated by a European treaty organization, which could insure that the process is peaceful, orderly, humane, and as fair as possible to all parties. </em>(Johnson, 2015)</p>, <p>Geopolitical decisions in the petty-nationalist world are decided by morale principles rather than by cold calculations. They do not seem to consider the effects of these various decisions on the relative standing of the state in question to its competitors. Taking Quebec as a test case for these beliefs, under the petty nationalist world order Quebec would have long ago separated from the Canadian state. The Canadian state would surely be weakened by the loss of the vast natural resources of Quebec, its industrial base, and control over the St. Lawrence seaway which connects the Canadian core, Ontario, with the wider world. The fact that Quebec separatism was indulged on two separate occasions with a popular vote, and close ones at that, is indicative of the power of the American system. Losing such a large piece of territory would deprive that state of manpower, industry, resources, and provide an opportunity for rival powers to take this new state into their sphere of influence. This would only be compounded in the example of Quebec, where suddenly Canada would be cut off from its best ports in the East and from its most important trade route, the St. Lawrence. In the era preceding pax Americana, a successful separatist movement would have jeopardized the continued existence of a state by weakening its ability to defend itself. If Quebec were to have separated in the 19<sup>th</sup> or 20<sup>th</sup> century, Canada would likely have been absorbed by the United States. Today Canada could survive such an event because we are subjects of the American Empire. Today access to global resources markets and very likely the passage of goods through Quebec would be guaranteed, the United States not desiring economic chaos in its biggest trading partner. It is of no coincidence that separatism in states under the aegis of the American Empire is no longer considered a treasonous activity, unless that separatism is opposed to the American order of course. As well, it makes sense how in states outside of the American orbit, separatist regions and movements are not tolerated; examples can be seen in the Russian Federation and mainland China. The survival of these states as independent geopolitical entities means they do not have the luxury of supporting liberal moralism when it comes to the supposed right of self-determination.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3134">Quebec Separatist protest during the 1960 Quiet Revolution</p>, <p>The existence of global American power and the European Union gives the illusion that small European states can adequately function as independent entities. States with indefensible borders, tiny populations, little resources, and even without any access to the sea can thrive today. There is a common line of thinking that the horrors of the two world wars have made conflict between European nations unthinkable. But, this is not due to some fundamental pacifistic enlightenment spread after the destruction of WW1 and WW2, where we eschew violence and competition with our neighbours. It is because of the once bipolar and now unipolar nature of the current era, that we exist in an imperial paradigm. In his article “Grandiose Nationalism”, Greg Johnson lauds this as the vindication of ethnonationalism, as smaller states once subject to the Soviet Empire free themselves from tyranny:</p>, <p><em>Since the fall of the Soviet Empire, the tendency in Europe has been toward  ethnonationalism, either by the Czech and Slovak road of peaceful partition or Yugoslav road of war and ethnic cleansing. What is a more realistic path to peace: putting Yugoslavia back together, then Czechoslovakia back together, then unifying them both in a single state, with all the rest of Europe — or allowing peoples with long historical grudges to completely disentangle their affairs and lead their own lives? What is more likely to produce European amity: a shotgun wedding or an equitable divorce? </em>(Johnson, 2015)</p>, <p>But, these new states have not become truly independent entities. They quickly joined both NATO and the European Union for access to protection and the American global trading network. The use of military force as a means of furthering foreign policy aims has become unthinkable outside of Africa and the Middle East. To even consider that European states may enter into conflicts in the future, especially in the Northern European core, seems ludicrous. Geopolitical analysis is seen as something rather funny. It’s almost provincial to be concerned about the control of resources when any input the state needs can be purchased from almost anywhere on the planet. Not only can they be purchased, but they will arrive and arrive on time. Add to these conditions the overwhelming military superiority of America, where any aggressive action that destabilizes its order is dealt with punitively, and you can begin to see where our naive thinking on geopolitics comes from.</p>, <p>This is why Czechoslovakia can be split in two and it has little knock-on effects for the prosperity of the two nations as a whole. The Czech state need not be concerned with access to import and export markets, or even its own security. It does not even have to negotiate trade deals with its neighbours thanks to the European Union. The benefits of Slovak industry, manpower, and resources were useful to pre-war Czechoslovakia, but today the ability to defend your borders against aggressive neighbors is unnecessary. The emergent nation states that petty-nationalists laud are products of the very system they, generally speaking, oppose. If you take away this American pre-eminence and their control of the sea, which underwrites the existence of global trade, we land in a very different world. The Utopian thinking of the petty nationalist will be fundamentally challenged by the realities that states previously had to contend with in the pre-1945 world.</p>, <p>There is also a general pacifism in the views of the petty nationalists. This passage by Greg Johnson displays the naivete on the topic of foreign policy that is present in the petty-nationalist sphere:</p>, <p><em>The threat of non-white blocs should not be exaggerated. France, the UK, or Russia alone are militarily strong enough to prevail against anything that Africa, India, or the Muslim world can throw at us — provided, of course, that whites are again </em>morally <em>strong enough to take their own side in a fight. A simple alliance of European states would be able to deter any Chinese aggression. Thus a defensive alliance between European states would be sufficient to preserve Europe from all outside forces, whether they be armed powers or stateless masses of refugees and immigrants. </em>(Johnson, 2015)</p>, <p>What is most interesting about this passage is what is missing; everything is about deterrence and defensive alliances, but what about the projection of power? This is where the uni-polar world of the American Empire rubs off on us the most. It is here that there remains a large degree of liberalism in the dissident right. Europe needs only to defends its own borders; it does not to contend for the domination of Eurasia. But, that leaves Europe in a very tight spot. Europe is practically at the mercy of Russia to supply almost all of its oil and natural gas. If Europe is to be united together even in a simple defensive alliance this fact becomes very problematic. In a world where the United States has evacuated from Europe, Russia can use its near monopoly over much of Europe’s supply of oil to bring nations along its border back into its orbit. Europe as a loose alliance would practically be defenseless since its enemy controls such an important commodity, like Damocles sword handing over Europe’s head. If the tiny states of the petty-nationalist dream are to remain sovereign, they will have to at least form some alliance for the mutual extraction of resources, most importantly oil. This means they must project power into the Middle-East, North Africa, and/or West Africa to gain control over the distribution of oil, as well as protecting the convoy routes bringing it back to Europe. That fundamentally means engaging with China, Russia, Turkey, Iran, etc in a great power conflict. That brings us back to the flaws in petty-nationalist thinking, how can this assortment of sovereign states with uncoordinated militaries project power to compete with these powerful rivals?</p>, <p>The economies of scale required to maintain an adequate defense has been continuously increasing throughout history. Take for example the Dutch republic, which successfully defended itself against the much more powerful states of Spain and neighboring France throughout its early years. Denmark resisted various German states attempts at expansion northwards for centuries. Compare the success of these states in defending themselves a few centuries later against the Wehrmacht. What were once defensible and relatively powerful states were now defeated in a matter of days. As warfare has industrialized, larger industrial bases are required for the production of more advanced weaponry. The R&amp;D can be spread across different states, think the Eurofighter, as we see in Europe; but still small states cannot adequately adopt the full range of technologies required for a fully functional offensive military. This goes out the window if cooperation amongst European states were to break down. Designing cutting edge military hardware has become so very expensive, especially in terms of new aircraft, the per unit cost would be unaffordable for most states if the research was done alone. To utilize the full strength of combined arms in the 21<sup>st</sup> century requires a nation on the scale of the United States, Russia, or China. The cost of employing progressively more advanced weaponry prohibits small states from having capable defensive and especially offensive forces precluding substantial support from outside sources.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3139">Military band of the Chinese people’s Liberation Army in Jiujiang.</p>, <p>A European military would be able to project power outside of Europe, securing valuable resources the continent does not have. In a world with America as an absent superpower, the ability to trade globally will be determined by the strength of one’s navy and their ability to defend crucial seagoing trade routes. Major European powers such as England, France, and Germany could, after rearmament, still be able take control of West African oil reserves; but to compete with China or Russia, especially in the Middle East, will be far easier with most of Europe, especially the north, united. Furthermore, united they would be able to control far more resources and to regain control over lost territories. The vacuum created by America could allow the Chinese, Russians, or some other power to gain control over a large percentage of the Eurasian oil and strategic resources. This would force Europe to enter into a subservient relationship even without a military defeat, threatening the future prosperity of the continent. Or in another scenario where oil output dramatically decreases as various actors within the Middle East and Asia engage in conflicts prevented by American largess; for example, an Iran-Saudi war over Iraq or the Saudi Oil fields themselves.</p>, <p>Petty-nationalists claim that uniting much of Europe into a single state will create the intra-European conflicts that unity was meant to prevent. Deeply rooted ethnic animosities would bring this pan-European state down in its infancy. But, as of 2020 constant predictions about the imminent collapse of the European Union have not precipitated. The European Union remains a broadly popular institution across the continent. The European Union has moved to increase its power progressively over time without much resistance. At least in the present order, if the EU moved to centralize powers much further, I cannot foresee any conflicts arising from this, as long as France and Germany were cooperating. Like all states touched by the destructive effects of liberalism, the European Union has very major flaws; but these are matched and superseded by most of the member state’s national governments such as the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. The talking point describing the EU as the key instrument of some Kalergi plan is ludicrous as foreign immigration has clearly been spearheaded by the member states. As was mentioned previously, a Europe of sovereign states will be likely be dependent on foreign powers for its resources. Europe could be a location of proxy battles between extra-European great powers as they compete with each other for control of the Eurasian world island. A united Europe would be far less susceptible to interference by foreign states peeling off European nations into their spheres of influence.</p>, <p>Surely there will be conflict within a pan-European system and there will be a core population(s) which dominates the state. But, there has never existed these free and “sovereign” nations of petty nationalist dreams. Strong nations whether or not they are within a political union will come to exert large degrees of control over their weaker neighbours. In the case of pan-Europeanism, this relationship has been formalized allowing the greater integration of European militaries and economies into a global power more capable of projecting power. Poorer nations to the east and South will obviously have less of influence in the direction of such an empire compared to the wealthier Northern European states, but since the beginning of the industrial era this has clearly been the norm. The choice is not over a Europe of sovereign nation states proudly independent, but still respectful of each other, or Empire. It is between larger European nations, as they have always done, dominating the weaker states or an Empire that formalize this conflict inside its imperial system. Obviously, such a state will not be unitary but will be federal in nature; this could actually allow the partial autonomy of smaller nations like Catalonia that the petty- nationalists desire. The economy, military, science, and foreign policy would be controlled at the European wide level.</p>, <p>In fact, the European Union as an institution could be the fertile ground where Europe reforms itself as American power recedes. In this post-American scenario, no one state can partially monopolize the use of force to further its foreign policy objectives. In this world, the scope of useful state policies will decrease dramatically. The liberal dogmas concerning immigration and race will become impediments to national cohesiveness. The feminized society is not a society conducive to struggle. The attack on every western states core population will necessarily be stopped. The end of the prosperity and peace of the American era would likely act like Darwinism in the realm of politics. Due to the selection factors of the American order, states could follow liberalism to its ultimate logical conclusion. Prior to this order, decadent nations could not persist without reforming or falling to more virile external forces. The destructive effects of liberalism while still acting were at least held back by the necessity of national defense, that all changed in 1945 and radically accelerated after the breakup of the Soviet Union.</p>, <p>This Darwinism at the level of the state can be clearly viewed by comparing the early years of the Soviet Union with the Stalinist era. The Soviet Union attempted radical anti-hierarchical and feminist experiments during its inception. Many of the progressive policies of the Soviet Union were subsequently put on hold and reversed as the Soviet Union was threatened by outside powers, especially at the start of WW2. Stalin eliminated abortion as a means of increasing population growth during the great patriotic war. Many ideological leftist dogmas that threatened the state’s ability to make war were thrown aside while many of those previously associated with reaction were brought back. Russian nationalism and a subservient church were far more useful for the expansion and war making ability of the Soviet State than internationalism and radical experiments in family organization. This occurred out of necessity, either a state reforms and abandons degenerative policies or eventually it would be defeated by its rivals.</p>, <p>There is likely not much we can do prior to the challenging of American power by some exterior force. When that day comes the political sphere will open as some elites will search for useful ideas as to how to strengthen the ailing American state. We must be there with a coherent set of ideas that will be useful for the searching elite in the coming post-liberal era. The same will occur in Europe; there are already some stirrings in the water from President Macron about the need for a European army in a post NATO future. Macron has signaled a slight change in tack on the immigration question, perhaps it is a cynical ploy to steal attention from National Rally. Or it could be the beginnings of a European reorientation responding to the absenteeism of the American superpower. If our ideas are correct, the stop-gap benefit of mass immigration which is aimed at combating the very real problem of our aging demographics will quickly become a liability for various states survival in a more chaotic world. A distinctly possible scenario where the EU fractures as a response to the withdrawal of American support, and likely Russian interference, would lead to a far worse conflict than tensions between different constituent EU member states, which are constrained within the bureaucratic framework of the EU. Europe’s declining population is already requiring extra-European export markets for a growing percentage of industrial and luxury goods. Without the ability to sell these items abroad at competitive rates; Europe faces severe economic problems as a norm, especially combined with the ever-growing public spending associated with an aging population. This could lead more powerful states within the EU, out of economic necessity, to force neighbors into subservient relationships to create some market for their goods, acquire natural resources, and to use military technology created with the excess production. A state encompassing most of the Europe could apply these energies outside of Europe, particularly towards securing oil reserves and export markets in the Middle East and West Africa as well as containing an aggressive Russia, moving west in search of more defensible borders.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3133">Ernst Junger, 1920</p>, <p>Now that we have questioned whether the world desired by universalist ethnonationalists is possible, let us ask the question, is it even desirable? If you could supply all of Europe with the resources it needs to function, ensure its defense, and prevent conflict: would it be good to carve Europe into many independent states? If your only goal was the survival of individual European ethnic groups and some sort of traditionalist cultural rejuvenation, then this position would be sufficient. Given the history of the European civilization, this does not seem to be a sufficiently lofty goal for the Faustian man. To be cocooned in our respective countries untroubled by the outer world but also not exerting our will to power upon it, is an unsatisfying future. The true universalistic ethnonationalist position resembles only a slightly altered version of Francis Fukuyama’s own prediction. A world of ethnostates, stable due to homogeneity, frozen in place due to a lack of conflict. If you followed the logic of the proponents of ethnonationalism you would find history over, completed. It is easy to choose interesting times over stability from the comfort of your own home. But, who on the right can look through history and wish there will be no more empires to rival Rome, no grand conquests, no new mythic battles like Trafalgar and Agincourt? To make sure the surely unpleasant and violent, but oftentimes heroic, side of human nature stays in the history books. We would create no men in our own times to rival Ernst Junger, a true aristocratic of the soul. We would be left with a civilization stuck in the Spenglerian “culture” phase; either reproducing the same styles of art, architecture, and music that has come before or following the rabbit hole of deconstructionism further into the abyss. Perhaps the advanced technics of such a civilization could stop external enemies from defeating it, even for centuries. Such nations would be like enclaves depicted in the film <em>Zardoz</em>, highly civilized but ultimately stagnant.</p>, <p>That is why we must support Empire over our continued obsessions with little nation states. Even if these states could survive and even thrive after the decline of the American Empire, it would only lead to our own spiritual deaths. Faustian man needs to finally embrace the Spenglerian “civilization” phase of our existence. To unite the different European peoples under one flag, giving us the power to step away from the precipice we are inching towards. Then to spread our flag to the different corners of the globe, to create an Empire worthy of those that came before. We must think on a grand scale, first to ensure our premier place on this planet, to protect its environmental viability, and to provide enough resources so we can look towards the stars. It might never be possible to economically mine distant asteroids or to create self-sufficient colonies on Mars. But, this to me seems like a much more inspiring future than to aspire to a return to the small states and the small scale thinking of a bygone era. We should strive for a future where the full range of human existence is possible, both comfort and security but also the self-actualization through combat, which Junger and others have described. Perhaps the dream of a united Europe is also not possible without American military support; that the European nations will fall into conflict as the demographic replacement leads to our civilizational eclipse. But, let us aim for a future that is grander and far more interesting with new cultures, new empires, and new horizons than mere existence, as prescribed by the petty nationalists.</p>, <p>Type on the field below and hit Enter/Return to search</p>][][<p>With the rise of the BLM movement, we are not just witnessing protests and riots but the birth of an old/new religion.

In order to have myth, what is needed is that the culture in which it appears would be…</p>, <p>In order to have myth, what is needed is that the culture in which it appears would be a mythological one. This culture supposes a complex group of mythical categories, among them those of time, space and causality. Mythoid lacks the transcendental character of myth, it isn’t, above all, overlapped with the totality of the culture in which it works. It is, in certain sense, isolated and could even oppose essential aspects of a given culture, but possess the fundamental characters of myth. (Miro Quesada Cantuarias, 1986:84-86). As exposed, <strong>myth</strong>, understood as a <em>fact or event which does not have empirical correlate</em>, is differentiated from <strong>mythoid</strong>, by the socio-cultural framework in which it is produced, by which in contemporaneity we would talk more of the generation of mythoids than myths, given that our current culture is found inside of a logocratic (reason) framework eminently and not a mythocratic one.</p>, <p>Following the aforementioned, <strong>one of the mythoids of our contemporaneity is configured in the belief in the fact that science enjoys of an absolute neutrality</strong> in which <em>scientific research</em> (<em>creation of explicative theories</em>) and <em>technological application</em> (<em>execution of theories already given to concrete cases</em>) are not just one. Disconnected, but instead they are at the same time, estranged from external powers which could exert influence in them.</p>, <p><strong>This mythoid has a clear origin in Popperian vision inside of the philosophy of science</strong>, in which precisely the separation between scientific research and technological application is made. For Popper (1970), scientific research has, as such, an intrinsic value which is guided by determined norms of methodological character that could have a moral content, insofar as the objective of the investigation is the discovery, and thus the results of such research also have that inherent value, but are neutral regarding the moral. That one could make good or bad use from the results of a scientific research <em>a-posteriori</em> is an entirely different thing. So, the scientist has two obligations, to follow the moral requirements of the very same scientific praxis (the scientist as scientist), and to limit himself to foresee the possible uses of his results and denounce its bad praxis (the scientist as citizen).</p>, <p>This Popperian approach, which is the traditional one, opposes the historic-sociological approach of epistemologists like Bernal (1939) and Richta (1971), where it is remarked that by the nature of the scientific research, the scientist –in effect– has a double responsibility, to follow the norms of the scientific method, but above all to involve himself in an active way in the changing of society in order for science to fulfill its role of serving mankind, insofar as one is conscious that scientific knowledge could be used both in order to liberate and in order oppress mankind. These are symptomatic facts which are derived from the lacking of the very same social system to which science serves. Meaning, scientific research and technological application are not separated concepts, but instead they keep an intrinsic relationship.</p>, <p>This last point is reaffirmed by the fact that in the praxis of scientific research, the search for some theories or others and the choice between them is not an entirely free enterprise, remembering Quintanilla (1978), regulated exclusively by the canons of objectivity and in service of truth, as the unmistakable reality is that the scientist is a wage worker whose priorities of research are given as such to an order of priority which is established by particular interests which are the ones who direct, what things can be researched and what things are left relegated, “to the extent, for example, that research devoted to a determined topic are financed and not others, etc” (1978:54). As was exposed, “<strong>it is clear that we must renounce the comfortable consolation or illusion that science, in itself, has guaranteed autonomy and value despite the wrong applications that would be made of it circumstantially or despite its historical insertion in an unjust society” (1978:56).</strong><strong><br/> </strong></p>, <p>MIRO QUESADA CANTUARIAS, Francisco.

Their “national” days are unique in the world in that they celebrate historical events that were cast, at their very inceptions, as liberal advancements for all humankind.</p>, <p>Today, of course, every nation-state on earth—from Nigeria to North Korea—mouthes some sort of “human rights” mumbo-jumbo. But the U.S. and France are exceptional in that they emerged as direct ideological expressions of the Enlightenment, and occurred at a critical moment in its history. One hundred years after the death of Spinoza, the French and American Revolutions marked the point at which Enlightenment values left the realm of philosophy (and what could be called the 17th-century “radical fringe”) and entered the realm of state-making and geopolitics. Both Revolutions would, in turn, occur some 125 years before the Great War definitively ended the Old Order. Every state thereafter would be “American,” the vestiges of aristocracy and monarchy persisting only as tourist attractions.</p>, <p>“The Rights of Man” . . . “the pursuit of happiness” . . . “inalienable rights . . . endowed by our Creator” . . . The great slogans and myths of 1776 and 1789 have a quaint ring to them today. They hail from an older phase of the Left, and thus have become, as it were, “conservative.”</p>, <p>These platitudes function like dogma and form the unexamined basis of political action and speech. This is most obvious through a familiar political shorthand; in the words of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FOO3OJYbTU">Congressman Paul Ryan</a>, America is “more than just a place . . . America is an <em>idea</em>.” (As geography is thrown out the window, so is race, people, culture, history, and more.) Ryan’s meme is reiterated across the spectrum—from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg3Xzh2cXD8">rock star’s urgings</a> that Americans be “one” with the world, to the inaugural addresses of Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama. Much of political discourse in America involves politicians accusing rivals of not believing in the American dogma hard enough.</p>, <p>To be an American is to be committed to liberty, equality, and individual autonomy—perhaps even to have left one’s home and people in the name of such principles. America’s highest ideal is, in a way, an <em>anti-ideal</em>—that the state shall <em>not</em> express a people’s spirit and history, a source of wisdom or tradition, or a vision of something greater, more dominant and powerful than an individual. The character of America is imagined as an endless <em>tabula rasa</em> or Etch-a-Sketch; it gets written on, but always returns to zero.</p>, <p>The “Founding Fathers,” as they are know, are revered not so much as martial heroes but as the wise designers of the world’s greatest legal mechanism. There seems to be no parallel in other Occidental cultures to the reverence of the Supreme Court, as a set of nine Talmudic Judges who, depending on your persuasion, will either divine the Constitution’s One True Law or else view it as a living will.</p>, <p>Other countries might have <em>negative</em> national consciousnesses. Germans, for instance, have internalized de-Nazification. But Germans remain, despite it all, self-consciously German. Americans, on the contrary, are <em>nothing</em> . . . they’re always starting over . . . they like to tell themselves they have an unbounded future, but only at the cost of never having a past.</p>, <p>One can be an American and also be Roman Catholic . . . a Muslim . . . a Buddhist . . . or a trans-gendered performance artist. American society is, indeed, encouraged to fragment into as many pieces as possible. So long as no identity, ideal, or meaning predominates over others; so long as every identity ultimately wants the same.</p>, <p>Religion in America, particularly Protestant Christianity, has rarely opposed this anti-identity; at critical moments, it has reenforced it. There is a “storybook” history to the many fanatics, who, choosing to abandon their homes and cultures, sought to create a “new Israel” in the New World. What we call “tradition,” they called “corruption” and “poison.”</p>, <p>One could imagine an alternative reality in which American religious institutions had opposed the 1776 Revolution (or at least had been highly skeptical of it), urging loyalty to mother country and mother church. Instead, the 18th-century pulpit was a place of revolutionary fervor. Jefferson’s Independence Declaration had resonated with—and was, indeed, continuous with—a whole series of “compact” beginnings for Christian Americans, who in a spirit of Hebraic separatism, desired to break with Europe.</p>, <p>The Europeans had been Germans . . . Gauls . . . Russians . . . Lombards . . . Britons before they were Christians. In their national consciousnesses, they could remember conversion experiences. Americans, on the contrary, were Christians before they were Americans.</p>, <p>One could counter that the American dogma is all rhetorical—that the Founders, some of the wealthiest men on the continent at the time, sought to secure an aristocratic order, that American society has been informed by ethnic, political, and monetary agendas, etc.</p>, <p>But to understand America, one must understand its <em>outcome</em>—that there are certain impulses and implications that only become clear later on (ironically, when the entity has reached its end point). Today, the United States has achieved the most robust and most popular civic religion that explicitly denies its racial, historical, and civilizational identity. This <em>spiritual</em> negation is more devastating than the displacement of the founding stock through mass immigration.</p>, <p>Our perspective is of living in America, without being of it. As we escape America’s assumptions, we can look upon the entity objectively.</p>, <p>A century and a half ago, Alexander Stephens, Vice-President of the Confederate States of America, was faced with the prospect of the victory or annihilation of his nation and fledgling state in what is now referred to as the American Civil War.</p>, <p>In his greatest address, “The Cornerstone of the Confederacy,” he did not speak (mendaciously) about “states rights” or any kind of Constitutional legality. He instead cut to the heart of the social order he was opposing. He stressed that the Confederacy was based on the conclusion that Thomas Jefferson was wrong; the “cornerstone” of the new state was the “physical, philosophical, and moral truth” of human inequality.</p>, <p>Ours, too, should be a declaration of difference and distance—”We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created unequal.” In the wake of the old world, this will be our proposition.</p>, <p><em>This article was originally published on July 4, 2014.</em></p>, <p>With the rise of the BLM movement, we are not just witnessing protests and riots but the birth of an old/new religion. Summary The Black Lives Matter protests are best…</p>, <p>The Black Lives Matter protests are best understood as a religious revival, emerging from the United States but global in scale. This new religion is “Multiculturalism” and based on institutions and ideals outside traditional churches; however, its structure and sacraments strikingly resemble those of Christianity. It could even be considered a kind of heresy.</p>, <p>Religious revivals take place in the wake of wars and disasters, periods of elevated stress and widespread angst. They are spearheaded by and attractive to people who are relatively high in neurotic traits such as anxiety. Their disturbed mental states are, temporarily, alleviated by the religious experiences that take place through these revivals—with religion, more generally, being an adaptation that allows us to cope with an unpredictable and traumatic world.</p>, <p>Leftists and atheists, of course, proudly reject traditional religion and sexual morality, and we should appreciate the irony of a “religious revival” capturing their hearts and minds. However, as a group, leftists and atheists are high in mental instability—especially those who are young and female—and thus they are highly susceptible to the religious <em>experience</em>, if not religion as it has been historically understood.</p>, <p>Following the Industrial Revolution and the exploitation of fossil fuels, the world became immensely wealthier, healthier, and more comfortable, and the harsh Darwinian selection pressures that characterized previous ages subsided. One of the most impactful consequences of this is the dramatic decrease in childhood mortality. Thus, millions of people with high levels of mutations, who would not have survived childhood in previous times, walk among us in the postmodern age. These “spiteful mutants” have managed to bring about the collapse of traditional religion—which is associated with mental and physical health and evolutionary success. They have spread Multiculturalism as a religion in its place. The result is a Multiculturalist revival, where 70 years ago there would have been a Christian one.</p>, <p>Imagine there’s no countries <br/>It isn’t hard to do <br/>Nothing to kill or die for <br/>And no religion, too <br/>Imagine all the people <br/>Living life in peace <br/>You, you may say I’m a dreamer <br/>But I’m not the only one <br/>I hope someday you will join us <br/>And the world will be as one <br/><cite><strong>—“Imagine,” John Lennon</strong></cite> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement swept through the Western World beginning in May 2020 after the accidental death of African-American criminal George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. The initial result was widespread riots and looting by African-Americans in Minneapolis, followed by similar scenes in other places. But this quickly morphed into an ideological movement—under the already extant slogan “Black Lives Matter”<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="ffn1">1</a></sup>—in which a kind of anarchy swept through American cities, encouraged by Social Justice Warriors<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="ffn2">2</a></sup> and, to a large extent, the leftist media and political establishment. A kind of hysteria appeared to take hold among White Americans, including politicians and even police officers.</p>, <p></p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8jNcFfICVic" width="560"></iframe></p>, <p></p>, <p>Flagrantly breaking the “lock down,” which had been in action for two months due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Whites gathered in the streets and knelt in the name of George Floyd. Many police officers publicly engaged in this deferential behavior, often holding out their open hands to signify their willingness to make themselves defenseless. White Americans were filmed not just kneeling before Blacks but symbolically washing their feet.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="ffn3">3</a></sup> The riots were stated, by the media, to be “largely peaceful” even as buildings were aflame behind them or as White news reporters were physically attacked by rampaging mobs. There were calls to abolish the police and even for complete anarchy, under the slogan “No Justice, No Peace.”</p>, <p> </p>, <p>The hysteria quickly spread to other Western countries. There were Black riots— assisted by White SJWs—on the streets of central London. White news reporters were attacked live on air. British police, in front of the gates of Downing Street, knelt before Black protestors rather than arrest them for breaking the lockdown and for rioting, as English Law demanded. Companies began to signal their support for “Black Lives Matter,” with those who were slow to do so being criticized as “racist” because, according to one slogan, “Silence is Violence.” In a BLM protest in Helsinki, the overwhelmingly White and female “protestors” didn’t merely kneel but lay prostrate on the ground in order to signal total submission and deference. Young females posted videos of themselves online renouncing their Whiteness, showing their “solidarity” with BLM. In one extreme case, a woman smeared herself in excrement as a sign of abasement.</p>, <p></p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">TikTok influencers are covering themselves in their own feces to support <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOutTuesday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOutTuesday</a> <a href="https://t.co/mmJAfudemV">pic.twitter.com/mmJAfudemV</a></p>, <p><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>, <p></p>, <p>Then came the attacks on statues and other public monuments. A statue of Winston Churchill in central London was graffitied with the word “Racist.” Britain’s Cenotaph war memorial was desecrated, and a young Black woman attempted to burn the Union Jack that hung from it. The statue of an 18th-century philanthropist and slave trader, which had stood in Bristol since 1895, was dragged down by a mob and thrown in the dock. Other statues that “offended” the sensitivities of the mob were preemptively removed, likely never to be re-erected, to prevent their destruction, including one of Belgium’s King Leopold, which stood in Brussels.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>The streaming service HBO Max removed the American civil war epic <em>Gone With The Wind</em> (1939)—a film preserved by the Library of Congress as “culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant”<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="ffn4">4</a></sup>—after its romanticization of the South and depiction of African slaves was deemed unwatchable in the current climate. The chairman of Warner Media called the ban a “no brainer,” a curious choice of words.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="ffn5">5</a></sup> The BBC even removed from its streaming sites relatively recent comedies, made by liberal comedians only a decade ago, such as the light-hearted “Little Britain,” because “times have changed.”<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn6" id="ffn6">6</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>This wasn’t just mob rule and anarchy.

In April 2020, experts in the study of religion cautiously suggested that there might be some kind of religious revival in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis, though they focused on what might happen in churches.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn7" id="ffn7">7</a></sup> There are always religious revivals after or during wars, famines, and pandemics. Why would the Covid-19 be any different?</p>, <p> </p>, <p>In other words, we are witnessing another “Great Awakening.” But the religion of a significant portion of Western populations, and especially the young, is not Christianity. This new global religion of the 21st century is Multiculturalism. That said, Multiculturalism contains many elements of evangelicalism, both aesthetically and structurally, and perhaps could be viewed as Christianity’s latest mutation.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>In order to understand what has taken place, we need to make sense of what religion is; why “mortality salience” is relevant to it; and how, precisely, religious revivals occur. Once this is clear, we will see that Multiculturalism is not just an ideology, partisan politics, or passing fad; it must properly be understood as a religion itself.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>One of the key predictors of becoming religious is being confronted with your own mortality or that of your loved ones. No matter what an inveterate skeptic might say or write throughout his life, when told that his mother is in intensive care or his daughter has been in a car accident, there is a very strong possibility that, in private, he will beg God for help. “There are no atheists in foxholes,” as the saying goes. So-called “mortality salience” is an extreme example of the kind of psychological stress that appears to elevate religiousness. “Feelings of exclusion” seems to cause people to become more religious, too, as do periods of dramatic change, such as significant changes in government.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn8" id="ffn8">8</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>“Religion,” in the widely accepted sense of the word, involves all of the key components of an evolutionary adaptation. Religiousness is around 0.4 genetic; it is associated with physical and mental health partly at the genetic level;<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn9" id="ffn9">9</a></sup> it correlates with fertility; and specific parts of the brain are associated with it.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn10" id="ffn10">10</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>There are likely a number of non-exclusive reasons why religiousness evolved. One is that it promoted pro-social behavior. Those who believed in a god who told them to behave in a pro-social way were less likely to be cast out or killed by the pre-historic band and were, therefore, more likely to pass on their genes. A related possibility is that it reduced stress in the face of danger or as we become aware of our own mortality. Those who felt that their life had eternal meaning and that a god was constantly looking after them would be less likely to become depressed and anxious and would be more likely to pass on their genes.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn11" id="ffn11">11</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>Consistent with this, not only do people tend to become more religious at times of stress, they are more likely to have dramatic religious experiences, in which they do not merely vaguely feel that God is present but, as far as they are concerned, see Him and hear His reassuring voice.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn12" id="ffn12">12</a></sup> People who are high in neurotic personality traits are prone to depression and anxiety, these being manifestations of “mental instability.” Neuroticism seems to decrease considerably after one has undergone conversion and other religious experiences.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn13" id="ffn13">13</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>Intrinsic religiousness—genuinely believing in god—is negatively correlated with Neuroticism.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn14" id="ffn14">14</a></sup> We can see this in the average churchgoer of the past century, a man who conforms to the belief system of his community, intellectually believes in a higher power, but likely doesn’t take his religion overly seriously nor does he worship with particular emotional affect. On the other hand, extrinsic religiousness—outward conformity to religion—is positively associated with Neuroticism. We can think of the fanatic or obnoxious scold, someone who wears his faith on his sleeve, perhaps even so devoted that religion negatively affects his welfare.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Being a “religious seeker” is also associated with Neuroticism. This involves going through phases of mental instability that are alleviated by an unusual and often very extreme forms of religiosity, which are duly abandoned during periods of sound mental health.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn15" id="ffn15">15</a></sup> Overall, it’s reasonable to argue that religiousness would have been selected for, because it promoted mental health, with the result that mental health and religiosity have become genetically related, due to both being simultaneously selected over a lengthy period of time.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn16" id="ffn16">16</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>Religion also would have been “kin-selected.” You can pass on your genes indirectly by aiding your kin: your children share 50 percent of your genes, and more distant kin, such as nephews, share 25 percent. If a person were highly religious, it makes their kin more attractive, because of the associations between religiousness, pro-social behavior, and mental stability. This would help explain why some Islamic fundamentalists kill daughters who have dishonored the family. It is a way of signaling the family’s commitment to Islam and, thus, elevating kin selection.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn17" id="ffn17">17</a></sup> An ethnic group is, in the sense, an extended genetic kinship group and thus a means by which you can indirectly pass on your genes.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn18" id="ffn18">18</a></sup> It is has been found, using computer modeling, that groups that are highest in positive ethnocentrism (internal cooperation) and negative ethnocentrism (external hostility) tend to dominate others in the battle of group selection.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn19" id="ffn19">19</a></sup> There is evidence implying that religiousness is genetically associated with both kinds of ethnocentrism, because a part of the brain associated with ethnocentrism is also associated with religiousness.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn20" id="ffn20">20</a></sup> And the correlation between positive ethnocentrism and religiousness would make sense because a group would be more internally cooperate if it were high in pro-social traits and low in mental instability. But our key point is that religiousness has evolved, in part, as a means of coping with stress and mortality salience.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>The high female presence both in BLM protests and in churches is obvious to anyone who has ever attended either. And this shouldn’t be surprising. Women are more religious than men, across cultures, in terms of how likely they are to believe in God and engage in collective worship.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn21" id="ffn21">21</a></sup> In the United States, Catholics, Evangelical Protestants, Mainline Protestants, and Mormons are each 55 percent female. Some 70 percent of American women report an “absolute certainty” in their belief in a god, compared to 57 percent of men. American women are also much more likely to report that religion is important in their lives, and atheism is found twice as often among men than women (12 percent vs. 6 percent).<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn22" id="ffn22">22</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>This occurs because religion has been <em>sexually selected</em> for, too, as it is associated with being pro-social, rule-following (and thus not cuckolding your husband or abandoning your family and child), and with being part of a supportive group of co-religionists. These clear sex differences in the strength of religiousness will become significant later when we analyze the Black Lives Matter protests.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>There are a number of probable reasons for higher female religiousness, one of which is empathy. Females are higher than in empathetic behavior, which involves being interested in people’s feelings and being able to detect their feelings from external markers, such as facial expressions.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn23" id="ffn23">23</a></sup> There is evidence that people who are high in empathy transfer this ability over to the world itself, meaning that they perceive the presence of a “mind” or “higher power” simply from looking around the world. Accordingly, low empathy—that is, stereotypical autism—is associated with atheism.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn24" id="ffn24">24</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>Another reason may be adaptation to patriarchy. Females sexually select for male status because a high-status male is better able to invest in them and their offspring, meaning that both are more likely to survive.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn25" id="ffn25">25</a></sup> Until the Industrial Revolution, wealth and status strongly predicted completed fertility, and this is the case among pre-industrial peoples today. <sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn26" id="ffn26">26</a></sup> If males must invest resources in the female in order to obtain sexual intercourse, then they want to be certain that the offspring in which they are investing their resources are actually their own. The result is a system of patriarchy in which females are controlled by males such that male paternity anxiety can be reduced. This system of patriarchy will tend to be promoted by the society’s religion as divinely ordained, possibly because patriarchal societies reduce paternity anxiety, meaning that they, in turn, reduce inter-male conflict, thus causing males to be more internally cooperative. And, again, as computer models have shown, societies of internally cooperative people are more likely to triumph in warfare with competing societies.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn27" id="ffn27">27</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>This system of patriarchy, however, would mean that females would be strongly selected to be accepting of patriarchy and thus to be religious, as this is what the religion would promote.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn28" id="ffn28">28</a></sup> Consequently, there would be a religious “arms race” among females in order to obtain the highest-status males, especially in the kind of polygamous societies in which humans have lived for most of history, in which the highest status males monopolize the most desirable females. As such, we would expect females to be strongly prone to wishing to signal their virtue and, if religiosity were regarded as virtuous, to signal this. And they would be more convincingly able to signal it if they genuinely believed it.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>It is also clear to anyone that has ever attended a BLM protest that many of those involved—with their stereotypical unnatural colored hair and screams of righteous fury—are not mentally well. By contrast, females in churches appear sober and under control.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Why should traditional religiousness be associated with mental health? The answer lies in its evolutionary history. In understanding the evolution of religion, it is worth noting that it is a combination of a variety of traits, which would have been adaptive in pre-history.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>1. Agency Over-Detection.</strong> We have a cognitive bias towards detecting the presence of an agent behind events. Following the “Smoke Detector Principle,” it is adaptive to assume the worst and get it wrong—such as to assume that that noise over there was a wolf rather than just the wind. This helps to explain why we might see evidence of god in the world.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>2. Pattern Over-Detection.</strong> We are evolved to over-detect causation. This is adaptive because those who under-detected it would have put themselves in danger of being wiped out or not been able to analyze and understand the world around them.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>3. Follow the Leader.</strong> We are evolved to form <em>strongly-bonded groups</em> and <em>obey authority</em>. By working as a team with a leader, groups are more likely to survive in the battle of group selection.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn29" id="ffn29">29</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>Religions will vary in the extent of the prominence of each of these factors. This means that although religiousness is generally adaptive in an evolutionary sense of promoting individual and especially group fitness, it is quite possible for maladaptive forms of religiousness—which do not promote genetic fitness—to manifest. Some devotees might be, for example, too extreme in their obedience to the leader or in their pattern over-detection, such that adhering to such a religion is harmful for its followers. An obvious example of this would be suicide cults—such as the notorious Jonestown—in which devotees are so inclined to follow their leader and so inclined to over-detect patterns that they accept a mentally ill man’s paranoid worldview and kill themselves, completely destroying their genetic interests.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn30" id="ffn30">30</a></sup> Membership of such groups is associated with other maladaptive traits—such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder—whereas traditional religiousness is genetically associated with mental health.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>The relationship between religiousness and sound mental health makes sense if we delve a little deeper into how religiousness has been selected for over time. This will also be highly relevant, later, to understanding the nature of the Black Lives Matter movement. As I have discussed in my study “The Mutant Says in His Heart, ‘There is No God,’”<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn31" id="ffn31">31</a></sup> we were under conditions of harsh Darwinian selection until the breakthroughs of the Industrial Revolution, which began in around 1800. The resulting improved public health and living conditions meant that child mortality has fallen from around 50 percent in 1800 to 1 percent today.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn32" id="ffn32">32</a></sup> High child mortality ensured that the surviving population was very strongly adapted to its ecology. Babies with mutations that made them unfit—such as those leading to a poor immune system—were purged from the population every generation, meaning that it overall had a very low “mutational load.” Under these brutal conditions, traditional religion—based around the collective worship of a moral god—was adaptive, meaning that it came to be selected for in tandem with other adaptive traits, which thus became genetically connected.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>With the break-down of harsh Darwinian selection, we would expect the population to display increasing evidence of mutational load. This would be observed in secular increases in the prevalence of partly genetic medical conditions.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn33" id="ffn33">33</a></sup> We would also expect the development of all kinds of deviations from this delicately balanced Darwinian religious norm—deviations that would be maladaptive in terms of group and individual selection and that would be attractive to people with maladaptive traits, such as mental illness. Religious suicide cults, such as Jonestown and Waco, would exemplify this process. These religious deviants would have high mutational loads and likely be people who would not have survived childhood under harsh Darwinian conditions.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>How do we know that such people would not have survived? In that the brain is 84 percent of the genome, it is an enormous target for mutation, meaning that those who have physical mutations can be expected to have mental mutations as well, which would direct them towards deviations from the most adaptive form of religiousness. Consistent with this, it has been found that, in modern samples, collective worship of a moral god is genetically associated with physical and mental health and is negatively associated with other markers of high mutational load, including autism, physical asymmetry, and left-handedness. These are associated with atheism or religious deviations, such as paranormal belief. The inability to develop a symmetrical phenotype implies a poor immune system, because a person with a poor immune system would have to use disproportionately more of his bio-energetic resources to fight off pathogens, meaning insufficient resources left over to ensure symmetry. Left-handedness is an accepted marker of “developmental instability.” If the brain develops symmetrically, people will tend to be right-handed. Failure to do so implies mutational load and, thus, left-handedness is associated with many examples of poor physical and mental health.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn34" id="ffn34">34</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>So, with the nature of “religion” and its connection to mortality salience understood, let us now turn to making sense of “religious revivals.”</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>Religious revivals appear to occur when the kind of situation that would lead to a period of religiousness in an individual—such as stress and mortality salience—are experienced relatively suddenly by a substantial portion of a society. There will be variation in the nature of the revival, depending on the kind of people who are impacted. But, in general, dramatic change and a period of difficulty can be expected to lead to a religious revival of some kind. These can be charted throughout history and, interestingly, there is often a time lag separating the period of stress from the revival itself.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Christian evangelists are constantly attempting to create revivals, traveling to different communities and preaching their message of conversion and redemption. However, they only seem to be able to create mass revivals during, or just after, periods of significant distress.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>An examination of British revivals during the 20th century is consistent with this pattern. The first major revival of the twentieth century took place in Wales between 1904 and 1905. At the time, South Wales was ravaged by industrial unrest and unemployment in a society in which there was no welfare state. Accordingly, Welsh workers, many of whom were already heavily influenced by Methodism and were facing serious hardship and the realistic possibility of destitution.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn35" id="ffn35">35</a></sup> Interesting, there was no religious revival during World War I in the UK, nor during the Spanish Flu pandemic that immediately followed it<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn36" id="ffn36">36</a></sup>. There were, however, various revivals during the 1920s. The lack of communications at the time meant that it was more difficult than in the 1950s for these to become national phenomena. A major revival in East Anglia in 1921 focused around socioeconomically deprived fishing communities, which were under considerable distress even compared to ordinary people recovering from the Great War. The following year, there were revivals in other parts of the country, most notably in fishing communities in northeast Scotland.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn37" id="ffn37">37</a></sup> There was no major revival in Britain in the 1930s, other than in the deeply conservative Hebridean islands off the north west of Scotland in 1939. This year was a time of elevated distress due to very real possibility that Britain might go to war again.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn38" id="ffn38">38</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>There was no major revival in the UK during World War II itself. The next Christian revival, and a concomitant reassertion of conservative attitudes, came after the War, and especially in the 1950s. There was a revival in the Hebrides in 1949, in which large numbers of people, who had not previously been especially devout, underwent religious experiences and became more involved in their church and in which those who were already religious became more fervent. According to revival leader the Rev. Duncan Campbell (1898-1972), in late 1949, in the village of Barvas on the Island of Lewis, he conducted a night-time meeting at which:</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>At 5 AM that morning, 14 buses full of people arrived from all parts of the island and even from the island of Harris. People at these meetings fell into trances, fainted, swayed and collapsed to the floor.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn39" id="ffn39">39</a></sup> Campbell felt that he had been inspired by the Holy Spirit to go and revive the Outer Hebrides and, given the stressful conditions of the time, people were extremely receptive to religious-fervor in a ways that they otherwise wouldn’t have been.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn40" id="ffn40">40</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>Wartime rationing did not cease until 1954, so it could be argued that it was only at this point that “normal life” finally reasserted itself.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn41" id="ffn41">41</a></sup> In an era of mass-communication, a spark was needed to set off a nationwide revival, and this came in the form of American pastor Billy Graham (1918-2018), as witnessed in his British rallies, which took place between 1954 and 1955. The postwar religious fervor was such that it has been estimated that roughly 21 percent of the London population attended a Billy Graham rally, while up 73 percent of the Glasgow population did so.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn42" id="ffn42">42</a></sup> In 1955, 100,000 people packed a Glasgow stadium to attend a single service conducted by Billy Graham.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn43" id="ffn43">43</a></sup> I am not aware that the relationship has been quantitatively tested, but, as a rule of British Modern History, religious revivals seem to manifest in areas of elevated mortality salience as a consequence of impoverishment or, directly, famine and other highly stressful phenomena.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>What was happening, in terms of individual and mass-psychology, during these revivals? As we have discussed, quotidian, stable religiousness—in which you are religious all the time—is correlated with sound mental health. Even religious people who are mentally healthy, however, go through periods of stress and mortality salience in which they may become more religious. They may even undergo forms of what is known as a “religious experience.”</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Religious experiences are profound psychological experiences in which a person may be overwhelmed by a feeling of God’s love and even hear God’s voice or believe to have seen Him. In making sense of these kinds of experiences, American neuroscientist Andrew Newberg and colleagues argue that the mind has two effective systems, calming and arousal. When either of these systems is pushed to their extremes, through meditation or hyper-arousal—both of which can be achieved via religious services—they argue that it is dangerous for the body. Accordingly, the other system hits in, leading to alternative states of consciousness and intense psychological experiences.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn44" id="ffn44">44</a></sup> British biologist Richard Dawkins has suggested that they may be provoked by the way in which stress makes us highly instinctive, and thus prone to religious belief anyway. Dawkins also argues that we are also evolved to over-detect agency: as mentioned above, if we mistake a distant rock for a wolf, we have lost nothing, but if we make the opposite mistake, we may be killed. Accordingly, at times of very intense stress, we are much more likely to mistake some unidentified sound as the voice of God and, at the same time, find that our calming system would hit in. This would lead to an intense religious experience combined with feelings of relief and joy.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn45" id="ffn45">45</a></sup> Undergoing mild religious experiences—known as “spiritual” experiences—is about 0.3 heritable. Undergoing intense religious experiences is approximately 0.66 heritable.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn46" id="ffn46">46</a></sup> This high heritability might imply that the ability to undergo a religious experience is extremely beneficial, in evolutionary terms, because it combats stress and, due to its profound nature, keeps you low in negative feelings for a substantial period of time afterwards.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>However, we must distinguish between the “religious experience” and the “conversion experience”—and also between being “religious,” being “hyper-religious,” and going through a phase of being intensely religious. American psychologist William James (1842-1910) distinguished between the religion of the “sick soul” and that of “healthy mindedness.” The religion of healthy mindedness is characterized by relatively mild religious experiences. The religion of the “sick soul,” however, is marked by a dramatic conversion experiences, which occur at times of intense stress.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn47" id="ffn47">47</a></sup> Those who lead religious revivals—people such as Billy Graham—can be regarded as constantly “hyper-religious.” As already noted, this is associated with either schizophrenia or with being a severely depressive personality. Psychological studies of those who lead religious revivals have found that most of them display evidence of these pathological traits. They require, for example, the absolute structure and order which fanatical religiousness provides in order to allay their anxiety and frequently undergo intense religious experiences.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn48" id="ffn48">48</a></sup> Such is the nature of revival “leaders.” It may be beneficial for a healthy society to be able to maintain a very small percentage of such lunatics, precisely because they are able to inspire fervent religiosity in other people and religiosity is traditionally a means of promoting ethnocentrism. In this regard, it has been noted that tribal shamans tend to the same kinds of psychological characteristics as modern-day charismatic leaders.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn49" id="ffn49">49</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>But what about the followers, and those who become followers during a revival? What is their psychology? Religious revivals are characterized by the “conversion” type of religious experience, in which a person undergoes a kind of psychological breakdown and, to some extent, adopts a new identity, for example as a “Christian” or as “<em>real</em> Christian” in a way that they somehow were not prior to the revival.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn50" id="ffn50">50</a></sup> They, consequently, go through a transient phrase of hyper-religiosity. Transient hyper-religiosity is associated with high Neuroticism,<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn51" id="ffn51">51</a></sup> while bipolar disorder and bouts of depression also predict periods of extreme religious fervor, as does schizophrenia.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn52" id="ffn52">52</a></sup> Schizophrenia, and its milder forms, is also elevated at times of stress, just as is anxiety.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn53" id="ffn53">53</a></sup> There is a range of severity to schizophrenia-type conditions. Mild symptoms are summarized as “schizoid personality.” This is characterized by <em>anhedonia</em> (the inability to experience joy) and apathy. More severe is “schizotypal personality,” where the schizoid symptoms are accompanied by social anxiety, paranoid ideation, unconventional or paranoid beliefs, and, sometimes, psychosis. Diagnosable schizophrenia is a particularly severe manifestation of these characteristics.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn54" id="ffn54">54</a></sup> Having undergone a conversion experience has been found to be associated with having been, prior to that experience, high in anxiety and other Neuroticism traits.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn55" id="ffn55">55</a></sup> When people suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress, which is associated with high Neuroticism, they can develop a very specific kind of religiosity known as “spiritual struggle” or “negative religious coping.” Those who undergo this believe that God is punishing them for their sins, plead for God to intervene in the world, and project hostility towards out-group members. “Positive religious coping” can cross over with this, insomuch as it involves conversion, but this also involves the belief that God has forgiven you and that you are purified of your sins.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn56" id="ffn56">56</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>So, people who are high in Neuroticism—and even under the harsh Darwinian conditions prevalent until 1800, there would have been population variance in this trait—are more likely to become part of religious revivals. They will feel stress more acutely and will, accordingly, be more likely to become extremely religious in the aftermath of periods of intense societal distress. Females score higher than males in Neuroticism. For this reason alone, we would predict that females would play a noticeable part in religious revivals.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn57" id="ffn57">57</a></sup> Consistent with this, studies of religious revivals in the U.S. have found that “white and black women were among the most visible participants at religious revivals, where converts wept, wailed, writhed, and fainted as they received God’s grace.”<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn58" id="ffn58">58</a></sup> Neuroticism tends to decrease with age in males. But in females, Neuroticism decreases with age until adolescence and at that point, it increases, possibly due to the adaptive need to worry about one’s children. This can be seen most obviously among university students, where females in particular tend to suffer mental health problems of various kinds that they will often have recovered from by the time they are in their mid-20s.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn59" id="ffn59">59</a></sup> Neuroticism, in women, begins to decline in early adulthood.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn60" id="ffn60">60</a></sup> For this reason, as well as due to their higher general religiousness, we would expect females in their mid-teens to mid-20s to be attracted to religious revivals. In line with this prediction, there is detailed data on those who “came forward” to receive God’s forgiveness during Billy Graham’s British rallies. In London, 65 percent were female and 50 percent were under the age of 19. In Glasgow, 71 percent were women and 73 percent were under the age of 30.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn61" id="ffn61">61</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>Even those who are not sufficiently Neurotic to undergo religious experiences can be expected to be influenced by a religious revival if it appears to be sufficiently popular. Neuroticism predicts extrinsic religiousness, that is, religious outward conformity.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn62" id="ffn62">62</a></sup> People who are high in Neuroticism will fear being judged negatively or even being ostracized for failure to conform, meaning that they may fake religious fervor even if they don’t actually feel it. This means that religious revivals that become particularly prominent can envelop people who are far lower in Neuroticism than those who are, as they see it, “slain by the Holy Spirit.” Accordingly, popular revivals can generate a kind of group hysteria and thus appear far more popular than they really are. This is obvious when we consider how so many celebrities felt compelled to jump on the bandwagon of Black Lives Matter.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>So, with the nature of “religion” and “religious revivals” clear in our minds, we can now explore the “religious” nature of the Black Lives Matter protests. There are obvious parallels between 20th-century religious revivals—such as that that spear-headed by Billy Graham—and the Black Lives Matter revival. The leaders of the movement are extreme “liberals”—with this being clearly associated with mental instability, where conservatism and traditional religiosity are correlated with mental stability.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn63" id="ffn63">63</a></sup> The “revival” has taken place in the wake of a period of elevated mortality salience; in other words, it is a response to stress. Those who are drawn into it are politically liberal themselves, with this being associated with mental instability.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn64" id="ffn64">64</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>In many respects, Multiculturalism can be argued to be a secular “replacement religion” for Christianity—and perhaps even a kind of Christian sect. The same argument has been made with regard to Marxism and even some kinds of Romantic Nationalism.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>Traditional Christianity is based around a series of dogmas that you must accept in order to be regarded as a Christian and achieve salvation. These dogmas are sometimes logically incoherent—such as the Trinity—or require the acceptance of truth-claims that cannot be proved or are, on any reasonable basis, extraordinarily improbable. However, you signal your intellectual submission to the religious community by accepting these. This can be regarded as their purpose; they are tests of loyalty. In much the same way, Multiculturalism requires that you accept dogmas that are empirically inaccurate or patently nonsensical, such as that there are no race differences in intelligence or that everyone is “equal.”</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>Christianity also tends towards idolizing the “marginalized.” It preaches that “the last shall be first” and encourages its followers to empower those who are supposedly marginalized, and humble themselves, embracing a kind of sacred poverty. Similarly, Marxism idolizes the dispossessed in the form of the “worker”; Romantic nationalism worships the “peasant”; and Multiculturalism, as espoused by Whites, idolizes non-Whites, and the more different they are—culturally and genetically—from Whites, the more they are worthy of reverence. There is evidence that humans—being evolved to tightly structured groups—have two fundamental instincts: one towards climbing the social hierarchy and the other towards equality, as groups that are relatively equal tend to avoid collapsing into discord.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn65" id="ffn65">65</a></sup> Thus, religions that preach “equality” can be highly psychologically attractive, especially to those who are not close to the top of the hierarchy or who fear they will not be able to get there. This is consistent with evidence that males who are physically strong—and thus who would have been more likely to ascend the prehistoric hierarchy via winning fights and being sexually selected for—are more likely to hold conservative views that specifically favor hierarchy and inequality.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn66" id="ffn66">66</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>The third key point that Multiculturalism has in common with Christianity, though not with pagan religions such as Hinduism, is the salience of “guilt.” In general, “guilt” and “shame” both function to make people “know their place,” and thus conform and behave in pro-social, cooperative ways. Accordingly, a group that adopts a religion imbued with these feelings to an optimum degree would be likely to out-compete other groups.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Christianity is a religion to which “guilt” is extremely important—“central to the biblical message” as one theologian has put it.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn67" id="ffn67">67</a></sup> According to Christian dogmas, humanity is “Fallen” as a consequence of its “Original Sin.” In other words, God is perfect and all-benevolent, whereas humanity is inherently sinful and bad, living in a sinful, Fallen world. Indeed, it was cast down into this world from Paradise as a punishment for its wickedness. The only way humanity can gain salvation and forgiveness is to admit how sinful it is and humbly worship God and follow the commands of His Church. Worldly success is, in a sense, something for which you should feel guilty—unless you are certain that God has blessed you with this success—because it implies that you are insufficiently humble; you are failing to sufficiently repent for your wickedness.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>In much the same fashion, the Church of Multiculturalism tells its adherents that they are burdened by the Original Sin of Whiteness. White people are presumed to have treated people of other races in abominable ways, with images of slavery, the Holocaust, Jim Crow, and the like acting as symbols of their primal deeds. Whites must repent for their Original Sin by empowering those who are not White, such that racial “Equality” is attained. In the same way that wealthy people in Christian societies are “privileged” and must engage in charitable works to assuage their “guilt,” White people have the “privilege” of being “White”—not only being wealthy but enjoying that wealth at the expense of non-Whites, whom their ancestors brutalized, enslaved, or murdered. “Privilege” is the source of “guilt,” which must be assuaged through acts of humility and penance, potentially including not producing White children and adopting non-Whites instead.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Shame, though less obvious, is also germane to Christianity and its replacement religions. Those who refused to conform to Christianity could be “shamed” as devil-worshippers who might bring God’s anger on the community, and shunned accordingly. Those who do not “take the knee” for George Floyd or who remain silent, instead of publicly stating their support for Black Lives Matter, can be shamed as possible “racists;” with this term of abuse implying that you are not an adherent to the religious community. You are “Other.” This is because membership of the community is based around adherence to dogmas, not around blood-bonds, as is the case with pagan religions and with many forms of nationalism.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn68" id="ffn68">68</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>The key difference between the Church of Multiculturalism and Christianity is that there is no god—no non-physical existence. Moreover, Black Lives Matter represents an extremely “spiteful” form of religiosity, in the sense that there doesn’t appear to be any “forgiveness.” In Billy Graham rallies, you could “step forward” and be forgiven for your sins. In Black Lives Matter rallies, it doesn’t matter how many times you “take the knee,” there can be no forgiveness for your sin of being White. You must simply learn to live with the guilt, slightly assuaging it ever so often by campaigning to empower non-Whites.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>As previously discussed, we can conceive of two distinct kinds of religion: those which are selected for under centuries of Darwinian conditions—that tend to involve the collective worship of a moral god—and those which deviate from this norm. Due to the way in which mental health and religiousness were co-selected under Darwinian conditions as we have explored, this “traditional religiosity” is now positively associated with mental health, while deviations from it—such as New Age affectations or belief in the paranormal—are associated with anxiety and depression, either on-going or periodic. People who are high in mental instability can be expected to become highly religious in the wake of a crisis and being low in traditional religiosity as well as fervently left-wing correlates with being high in mental instability</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Accordingly, we would expect such people—self-identified “liberals”—to become extremely religious (in terms of their religious deviation) in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, and this is what we appear to be seeing. In previous situations of gravity, the overwhelming majority of the British population was Christian and believed, to varying degrees, in its doctrines. This would have meant that the relationship between being a traditional Christian and mental stability would have been much weaker than is now the case. It also meant that the revivals were Christian in nature, because this was the religious belief even of the kind of mentally unstable people who tend to undergo intense religious experiences. As already noted, a specific form of religiosity has been found to manifest among mentally unstable people suffering from high levels of stress—“Spiritual Struggle.” Those who felt the Holy Spirit during this revival would be, in general, relatively high in Neuroticism, something that would be soothed, temporarily, by their religious experience. Usually, their Christian zeal would be temporary. It would no longer be psychologically required once the period of stress was over and recovered from, by which time the factor that was elevating their anxiety to intolerable levels would have dissipated.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>In 2020, especially for younger people, their religion is Multiculturalism and <em>not</em> Christianity. Christianity is now the religion of a shrinking minority. Consequently, we would expect some variant on the kind of revival outlined above to occur in the wake of Covid-19, especially among such people. Its leaders, as with Christian revivals, would be mentally unstable people. However, many of the “followers,” caught up in the revival, would be prone to mental instability and would be going through a particularly acute phase of anxiety. As with a Christian revival, these feelings would be alleviated by the collective experience—in this instance of “Black Lives Matter”—in which they would feel a sense of certainty that they were morally superior; that they were better than most (“racist”) people; and that they were part of creating a paradise on Earth. Once the anxiety-reducing feelings this induced wore off, such people would no longer be subject to acute mortality salience and then they would return to being much less fervent believers in the Church of Multiculturalism.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>We would expect any such revival to be more pronounced among Multiculturalists than among Christians. Social Justice Warriors are irreligious and liberal, both of which correlate with mental instability. “Christians” are conservative and religious, both associated with mental stability. Accordingly, in a world in which remnant Christianity is associated with sound mindedness, a Multiculturalist revival in the wake of a pandemic becomes far more probable than a Christian one—though there still may be a Christian one of some kind in the near future. We would expect this Multiculturalist revival to be elevated among young people—because people go through a period of relatively high mental instability when they are young adults—and, in particular, among young females, because females are more religious than males and they are more prone to depression and anxiety. Multiculturalism is the “new religion”—the “new morality”—and thus females would be evolved to want to signal the extent of their adherence to it, being ultimately psychologically adapted to polygamous societies in which they must compete for the highest status males by strongly signaling their religiosity and sexual faithfulness.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn69" id="ffn69">69</a></sup> Females are also evolved to a patriarchal society in which decisions tend to be made for them by their fathers and husbands. With the breakdown of patriarchy, it has been argued that we would expect females—especially young females—to make particularly maladaptive decisions.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn70" id="ffn70">70</a></sup> These would include strongly aligning with a religion that seeks to destroy their ethnic group and effectively encouragers them to be childless.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>It should be noted that, in relatively religious societies, females tend to be more politically conservative than males, seemingly because females are more religious and the religion promotes “traditional” values as the will of God. However, when the influence of traditional religiousness breaks down, the female propensity towards higher empathy—and thus leftism and anti-traditionalism—begins to manifest. In 1992, in Britain, women born in the 1920s were more conservative than men of the same age. However, women born in the 1960s were <em>less</em> conservative than males of the same age.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn71" id="ffn71">71</a></sup> These younger women, no longer as influenced by traditional religious ideas, tend to promote leftist ones—including altruism towards competing ethnic groups—with a kind of religious zeal. One commentator astutely termed them “The New Church Ladies,” evoking the subterranean religious quality to so much of contemporary female discourse.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn72" id="ffn72">72</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>Traditional religiousness took the female propensity to strongly believe in God and engage in religious worship and focused this into an adaptive form of religiosity in which God promoted group-selected values. With the breakdown of this religion, we are left with females tending to be religiously fervent and high in generalized empathy and thus attracted to Multiculturalism and leftism. Females are also higher than males in Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism, and, thus in social conformity.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn73" id="ffn73">73</a></sup> So, for this reason as well, we would expect them to be more heavily involved in the New Church into which younger females have been inculcated.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>It has been observed that highly educated young people—those with post-graduate degrees—are significantly over-represented among Black Lives Matter activists.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn74" id="ffn74">74</a></sup> One possible explanation for this—beyond the fact that university Humanities and Social Science departments are increasingly indoctrination factories for leftist ideas<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn75" id="ffn75">75</a></sup>—is that there is a positive relationship between Neuroticism and academic success at university, especially when this is combined with high Conscientiousness (impulse control and rule-following).<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn76" id="ffn76">76</a></sup> This is possibly because anxiety acts as a motivator towards diligence or because Neuroticism means you desire greater certainty about the nature of the world and believe you can attain this through higher education. In that Neuroticism predicts extrinsic religiousness<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn77" id="ffn77">77</a></sup>—that is, outward religious conformity—we would expect non-SJWs who were relatively high in these traits to be drawn into this dominant, public revival due to their fear of not conforming, leading them to compete to strongly outwardly conform.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>The other difference between the British religious awakenings in the 20th century and Black Lives Matter is the anarchy involved: BLM activists flagrantly breaking the law, engaging in dangerous behavior, rioting, inciting perpetual disorder (“No Justice, No Peace”), and engaging in iconoclasm by toppling statues and desecrating memorials. In this sense, a clearer comparison can be found in the Peasants War that took place in German-speaking states in the 1520s, in the early days of the Reformation. There are multiple reasons why the Reformation began when it did, but one of them was a period of elevated mortality salience. There had been severe famine in Germany between 1515 and 1520.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn78" id="ffn78">78</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>Reports indicate that violent Protestant mobs would strip Catholic Churches of their valuables and destroy their idols. As with Black Lives Matter, educated people were heavily over-represented among early Protestant iconoclasts—they were mainly the so-called “middling sort.”<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn79" id="ffn79">79</a></sup> The Protestant leaders would oppose iconoclasm, publicly stating that idols should only be removed with permission from the proper authorities. But, as has occurred in Britain in 2020, the Swiss authorities preemptively removed icons as a way of halting public disorder and also as way of appeasing Protestant leaders. In June 1524, all Zurich churches were closed in order to prevent a maelstrom.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn80" id="ffn80">80</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>In other words, Black Lives Matter is a particularly pronounced religious revival. In the 1520s, this occurred, in part, due to particularly difficult conditions. In 2020, it may be that the cause was moderately difficult conditions plus a growing percentage of young people who, partly for genetic reasons underpinned by increasing mutational load, increasingly suffer from depression and anxiety and, therefore, cannot psychologically cope with what would have been historically regarded as quite normal levels of mortality salience. Contemporary young people are increasingly in a situation of “evolutionary mismatch” where—under the influence of modern, anti-traditional ideologies, over-parenting, and education— they are decreasingly socialized as children in the manner that was the norm under harsh Darwinian conditions. This has been shown to lead to severe behavioral problems in non-human animals,<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn81" id="ffn81">81</a></sup> and we will explore this issue in more detail below.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Furthermore, far superior communications—social media and instantaneous reactions to events around the world—mean that what may otherwise have been isolated patches of revivalism have been globalized, impacting much larger numbers of people. And there may also be an extent to which these riots are in the interests of some powerful individuals, who are themselves fervent adherents to Multiculturalism or who desire a subservient population that will not challenge them. If the population is depressed and demoralized, this subservience is clearly better accomplished. Accordingly, the riots—which could be crushed if so desired—are permitted to run their course. It is as if ordinary people are being told: “Look what we can allow to happen to you if you elect the wrong people or vote the wrong way in a referendum.” Afraid of offending the righteous mob—and their high-level sympathizers—even leaders who oppose leftist disorder dare not act decisively. Again, comparisons to the iconoclasm of the early English Reformation leap to mind. Iconoclasts were permitted to “get away with it” during the periods when the Protestant faction, most notably led by Thomas Cromwell (c.1485-1540), wielded the most influence at Court.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn82" id="ffn82">82</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>All of this leads us to a final question. How have we reached a situation where so many people—including many in positions of power—wish to destroy their own extended kinship group?</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>Christianity, even the zealous kind of the Reformation, was an adaptive form of religiosity. Thus, a key part of it is “forgiveness”—after publicly confessing your sins and wavering of faith. With the breakdown of Darwinian selection, we see an increasing deviation from this religious evolutionary norm, including religions that are maladaptive, because they are ultimately nihilistic and lack doctrines that allow a person’s highly negative feelings during times of stress to be fully expunged. This is what we see with Black Lives Matter—the ultimate logic of which is that Whites should simply feel perpetual shame throughout their lives with no hope of it being alleviated, other than in a very mild and brief way via “taking the knee.”</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Young people have been inculcated with this maladaptive religion due, in part, to the breakdown of traditional Christianity, which, like all religions that survived under harsh Darwinian conditions, tended to take behavior that was adaptive in terms of group selection and turn this into the will of God. As discussed above, as child mortality collapsed, we had more and more people who would not have survived under harsher conditions—due to their high mutational load—who had mutations of the mind that caused to hold beliefs that would be highly maladaptive if held by even a small percentage of the group—anti-natalism being only the most obvious. Due to our being a highly eusocial species—that is, interacting in a “hive mind”—we are heavily influenced by those around us. In this way, it has been found that depression can spread like a contagion. If you are around a person who is depressed then you are more likely to become depressed yourself, a condition which is negatively associated with fertility.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn83" id="ffn83">83</a></sup> As a result, these mutants— <em>spiteful</em> mutants<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn84" id="ffn84">84</a></sup>—helped to spread their maladaptive ways of thinking even to non-mutants, gradually undermining adaptive institutions, such as traditional churches, and replacing them with their Church of Multiculturalism, a church which is now clearly adhered to even by the leadership of the Church of England.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn85" id="ffn85">85</a></sup> Having taken over the state’s organs of power, such as the education system and the media, they could then inculcate young people into the New Church, alter the evolutionarily adaptive methods of socialization traditionally imposed on them, and push them—and with them, the entire super-organism—to think and behave increasingly contra to their genetic interests.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>This became possible when a “tipping point” is reached, whereby about 25 percent of the population advocated anti-traditional ideas. Experiments have shown that when this happens, people perceive the new worldview as the way forward and begin to abandon the old one <em>en masse</em>.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn86" id="ffn86">86</a></sup> With our evolution to obedience and following the leader and the mob, this can sometimes result in a misfiring of our adaptations such that we start to engage in behavior which is not in our evolutionary interests. This is particularly likely to be the case if we are subject to “evolutionary mismatch;” if we are placed in an ecology to which we are not evolved. We are evolved to a pre-industrial ecology, so we can expect to find ourselves increasingly maladapted as the ecology increasingly deviates from this. We will engage in behavior which would have been adaptive under previous conditions – such as following the crowd – but this will be decreasingly adaptive as the crowd is increasingly evolutionarily mismatched, mutated and influenced by spiteful mutants.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>In 1954, this tipping point had not yet been reached in Britain. People forced themselves, for fear of ostracism, through so-called “effortful control,”<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn87" id="ffn87">87</a></sup> to believe in traditional Christianity, meaning that the revival was Christian and adaptive in nature. Around 1970, the tipping point was reached. This is demonstrated by the fact that evidence of mutational load – in the form of autism, which is associated with paternal age – did not predict atheism in the 1950s, but by the 1970s it did predict atheism. By the 1970s, in the U.S., having an older father predicted atheism in a way that had not previously been the case. This is because Christianity was so strong during the earlier period that autistics, who tend not to be religious as we have already noted, forced themselves to conform to the dominant religiosity. By the latter period, the tipping point had been reached, so they no longer needed to conform.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn88" id="ffn88">88</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>The Church of Multiculturalism, and its Black Lives Matter conversion rallies, is a Church with “spiteful mutants” as its priestly class. Under harsh Darwinian conditions, only those with adaptive cognitive biases survived childhood, because maladaptive cognitive biases were under-pinned by mutation, and those with high mutational load would likely perish before reaching adulthood. With the extreme relaxation of these conditions, these “spiteful mutants” walk among us in significant numbers. These are people who are programmed to behave in a way that is highly maladaptive in evolutionary terms—which results in the destruction of group and even individual fitness—and to persuade others to do likewise. All of the doctrines they advocate involve, if accepted, essentially being a “failure as an organism”:</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>The toppling of “racist” statues by the Black Lives Matter mob can be perceived as tearing down the “old gods,” those whom European people have venerated as heroes. These statues have traditionally been erected to honor highly group-selected people who have promoted the genetic interests of Europeans by expanding their territory and leading their ethnic group to victory over rivals. In a sense, the statues are sacred, they are idols; objects of worship. To tear them down is a way of asserting that the religion that they represented no longer has any power, is no longer sacred, simply because the idols that embody it can successfully humiliated.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>In 1520, Spanish explorer Hernan Cortes (1485-1547) destroyed every Aztec idol that he could and desecrated the temples. He noticed that it left the Aztecs demoralized and less able to put up a fight.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn89" id="ffn89">89</a></sup> So, this leaves the worshipers in a state of confusion in which the previously certain, uniquely real system by which they made sense of the world—and in which they played an integral and positive part—is an under assault. They feel confused because they have got used to this system, and the comforting presence of these statues, and they feel demoralized and anxious. Any significant change can cause this by virtue of elevating anxiety about the unknown.<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn90" id="ffn90">90</a></sup></p>, <p> </p>, <p>This, alongside the symbolism of the system that gives their life meaning being attacked, leads them to feel depressed and looking for new certainties. But what if the certainties offered are nihilistic and tell you that you are inherently evil and should debase and even destroy yourself, never able to be forgiven for your and your ancestors’ sins? This is the ultimate message of the Death Cult that is the Church of Multiculturalism. It is, therefore, no coincidence that it attracts the same psychological types who are attracted to literal suicide cults. Indeed, a Black Lives Matter Suicide Cult, in which young White women kill themselves to repent for their racist sins, would not be beyond the realms of possibility.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p>The Uncharted video game franchise is a flagship of the Playstation brand, having sold more than 41.7 million copies.

They’re among the most impressive, lavishly produced, movie-like video games ever made. The player’s avatar is a globetrotting treasure hunter clearly inspired by Indiana Jones. Just as <em>Indiana Jones</em> was co-created by Steven Spielberg, <em>Uncharted</em> was co-created by the Jewish Neil Druckmann, and these aren’t the only things they share in common.</p>, <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Druckmann">Druckmann</a> is an Israeli whose family immigrated to America when he was eleven-years-old. In college he co-created his first video game, an 8-bit demo called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_H8HlO5mVE"><em>Dikki Painguin in: TKO for the Third Reich</em></a> (which appears to be a hack of Act 2, stage 1 of <a href="https://youtu.be/Fq3nL57zLSc?t=289"><em>Ninja Gaiden 2</em></a>). It stars a cartoon penguin fighting Germans in World War Two. Suffice to say, Druckmann’s Jewish identity has informed his game design from the very beginning.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3307">Druckmann’s first video game starred a cartoon penguin fighting the German National Socialists.</p>, <p>Druckmann joined <a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/">Naughty Dog</a> – the Sony-owned subsidiary that created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Bandicoot_(video_game)"><em>Crash Bandicoot</em></a> games – in 2004 after meeting its co-founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Rubin">Jason Rubin</a> at an industry conference. Rubin is also Jewish, so perhaps that played a part in his hiring.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Rubin has since left the company and Druckmann is now vice president. Yet despite being born in Israel and repeatedly referencing the German National Socialists in his video games, Druckmann has attempted to downplay his ethnicity.</p>, <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.scpr.org/programs/the-frame/2016/07/13/50456/a-peek-into-naughty-dog-game-creator-neil-druckman/"><em>The Frame</em></a> Druckmann said, “I see myself as a pretty progressive person and yet (as a writer) my default (character) is a white, straight, christian [<em>sic</em>] male. That’s interesting because I’m Jewish and yet that’s the norm for me right now.”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> He’s right, that <em>is</em> interesting considering he surreptitiously casts Jews in leading roles! For example, the protagonist in Druckmann’s <em>The Last of Us</em> is evidently Jewish. This detail is never explicitly emphasized in the games’ surface narrative, but was confirmed in an official holiday illustration.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3310">An official holiday greetings card published on Naughty Dog’s official Twitter account shows The Last of Us’ Joel in a Hannukah sweater.</p>, <p class="has-background has-accent-background-color">Like his peers in Hollywood and <a href="https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2018/02/17/marketing-miscegenation/">advertising</a>, Druckmann has been keen to insert a radical left wing agenda in his stories. He inexplicably decided that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us:_Left_Behind">an interracial lesbian romance between teenagers</a> would appeal to his largely “White, straight, Christian male” audience, and doubled down with <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> (just released this month). In addition to promoting homosexuality, the company has hired a <a href="https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Ian_Alexander">transsexual</a> actor and made his/her character a transsexual, and one of the antagonists has been made more muscular since she was originally revealed, in order to be more “trans friendly.” In the aforementioned interview with <em>The Frame</em>, Druckmann confirmed that his games will feature fewer heterosexual White men moving forward:</p>, <p>“When you make a game, you have these different pillars that you’re trying to balance. It’s graphics, it’s gameplay, it’s story and you’re trying not to let any one pillar overwhelm the other. . . Recently, I realized that there’s this other pillar of diversity. That’s just as important as any one of these other pillars. I’ve kind of empowered <a href="https://wonderwomentech.com/speaker/emilia-schatz/">people on the team</a> that have made this their top priority. . . Can this be a person of color? Can this be a woman?”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>, <p>Incredibly, the above examples merely scratch the surface of the subversiveness of Druckmann’s games. What follows is an analysis of the four main <em>Uncharted</em> games (not including the PS Vita sequels or spin-offs), where we find clear examples of Jewish Esoteric Moralization (JEM), a subset of what mythologist Mark Brahmin calls <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/rem/">Racial Esoteric Moralization</a> (REM).</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3311">Abby, a character in The Last of Us Part 2, was “beefed up” in order to be more “trans friendly.”</p>, <p>JEM is a bit like Joseph Campbell’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero's_journey"><em>The Hero’s Journey</em></a> but with archetypes specifying <strong>racial</strong> groups. Whereas Campbell’s framework applies more or less universally, JEM encodes an incredibly specific <strong>racial subtext</strong> that champions Jewish men in resource competition with vilified White/European men. Often the battle is over sexual access to Aryan women. We refer to these groups as Semitic and Aryan (or Dionysian and Apollonian) respectively to clarify that this isn’t just a religious division.</p>, <p>That Jews have hidden a complex symbol language from us is not without precedent. The reader will no doubt be aware that they successfully hid the existence of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud#Middle_Ages">Talmud</a> from their European hosts for <em>hundreds of years</em>, and are <a href="https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2019/06/21/jewishness-and-the-culture-of-crypsis/">experts at crypsis</a>. However, it should be stressed that <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkBrahmin/status/1271447073737539589">not all Jews are cognizant</a> of the symbol language or would necessarily identify with its message. Indeed it appears that Jewish women are as benighted as Gentiles, as they are often the target of hatred and rejection in the JEM.</p>, <p>If every Jewish work of art was as obvious as <a href="https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2017/10/18/harvey-weinstein-on-jews-and-the-shiksa/"><em>Portnoy’s Complaint</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2017/10/31/jews-the-shiksa-ii-dustin-hoffman/"><em>The Graduate</em></a> or <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/02/21/meet-the-parents-as-semitic-bride-gathering-ballad-by-michael-frank/"><em>Meet The Parents</em></a>, even the dullest of Gentiles would catch on. With JEM, Jewish artists enjoy(ed) the freedom to subtly communicate and reinforce their worldview, safe in the knowledge that Whites would be blind to it. Take, for example, <a href="https://www.counter-currents.com/2010/11/uncharted-2/">this ill-informed piece</a> about <em>Uncharted 2</em> celebrating its supposed reinforcement of White endogamy. As will be demonstrated, precisely <em>the opposite</em> is true. Fittingly, the <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/05/07/the-micro-aggressing-evil-eye-the-hamsa-the-mark-and-the-third-eye/">blinding</a> and/or blindness of their enemies is a common motif.</p>, <p>Sometimes even non-White actors/characters portray an Aryan or Semitic cipher to camouflage the true meaning of a work. Brahmin emphasizes the importance of researching <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/what-is-in-a-name/">names</a> when examining esoteric art, as they’re often the key to identifying who is who. This is what we’ll be doing with <em>Uncharted</em>, as names cognate with Biblical and mythological archetypes (<a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/03/14/the-parabolist-law-of-microcosm-the-definition-of-a-god/">God Masking</a>), or that describe animals, plants, elements, colors, and other descriptors, can tell us if a character is Semitic or Aryan. For example, Apollo, Ares/Mars, and Zeus/Jupiter are archetypes that personify the Aryan male.</p>, <p>Today anti-White hostility is readily apparent in the media, but if you want to know when crafty Jewish authors are giving you the middle finger <em>behind the curtain</em> you must read Brahmin’s groundbreaking thesis at <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/"><em>The Apollonian Transmission</em></a> and in his upcoming books. It will open your eyes to a whole new world. The following analysis assumes you’re completely new to JEM, so you can pick it up as we go along.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3312">Naughty Dog vice president Neil Druckmann accepts awards for best writing in a video game at the 2014 and 2017 Writers Guild Awards for his work on The Last of Us and Uncharted 4.

It’s possible that none of his coworkers know about the subtext discussed below, but multiple Jews have held key positions on his titles. I bring this up not to suggest some sort of Jewish conspiracy (besides, perhaps, the oft-observed <a href="https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/category/jewish-ethnic-networking/">ethnic networking</a>), but rather because JEM is more likely given the circumstances. For example, lead writer Josh Scherr and lead designer Emilia Schatz are self-identified Jews. Several others have names and appearances that suggest Jewish ancestry (such as co-president <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/developer/shots/developerId,98062/">Evan Wells</a>).</p>, <p>Druckmann is curiously absent the third installment, <em>Drake’s Deception</em>, but I will touch upon aspects that appear to retain his signature.

The given name Nathan means “he gave,” while the longer Nathaniel means “god gave.” This is similar to the meaning of the Hebrew name John (lit. “graced by Yahweh” or “Yahweh is gracious”), the patronymic surname of Indiana Jones (lit. “son of John”). In other words, Yahweh has favored our protagonist.</p>, <p>Ironically, the Old English surname <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(given_name)">Drake</a> is what gives Nathan’s racial identity away; it’s a byname meaning “snake” or “dragon.” Ostensibly he adopted it after his childhood hero Sir Francis Drake, similar to Jones’ adoption of the nickname “Indiana.” Yet <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/02/08/garden-of-eden-part-iii-seth-as-serpent-seed-and-sargon-of-akkad-as-serpent/">the serpent</a> is one of the most important animal symbols in Jewish art – <a href="http://www.theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/11/06/the-blood-and-venom-of-the-serpent-the-juice-of-the-vine/">vines</a> and dragons are variants of it in the JEM – and these identify Semitic (or Judaized) figures.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Incidentally, Indiana Jones’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophidiophobia">ophidiophobia</a> (“<em>Why does it always have to be snakes?!</em>“) serves as an irreverent in-joke to cognizant Jews.</p>, <p>The surname Morgan isn’t mentioned much in the games.

It stems from the Old Welsh “Morcant” meaning “sea chief,” “sea protector,” “sea defender,” or “sailor/captain,” which may be a Biblical reference to Noah and Noah’s Ark. Indeed, both <em>Uncharted 1</em> and <em>Uncharted 4</em> begin with Drake aboard a boat, and water-based settings figure throughout the franchise. This is significant as water is an Aryan element in the JEM related to <a href="http://www.theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/03/26/baptism-and-anointing-a-symbol-for-copulation-with-aryan-women/">blood and admixture</a>.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Hence the surname implies that Drake is the master or shepherd of the Aryan flock and that he’s a casanova among its female sheep (his “ark”). This interpretation is corroborated by plot details discussed next.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3314">Nathan Drake, our crypto-Jewish hero, as seen in Uncharted 4.</p>, <p>Before we continue, neophytes should understand one of the key themes of the JEM. Namely, Jewish authors such as Druckmann are encoding a “mating call” in their work, which is well illustrated in <em>Uncharted</em>. The objects of their desire are blonde, blue-eyed (Aryan) women. The Jewish obsession with blondes is <a href="https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2011/07/12/how-rachel-weisz-wrecked-her-hollywood-prospects/">well-documented</a>,<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> and it is why Brahmin proposes that Judaism is a <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/the-bride-gathering-cult/">Semitic bride gathering cult</a>. For example, the name “Indiana” is another Jewish in-joke alluding to sexual intercourse with the Greco-Roman goddess Artemis/Diana, the personification of the coveted Aryan female. Imagine the <em>chutzpah</em> of marketing a film/character to a mostly White male audience that covertly boasts of their racial cuckoldry!</p>, <p>In the first game Drake becomes romantically involved with an attractive independent journalist named <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Elena_Fisher">Elena Fisher</a>.

Her eyes inexplicably changed from blue to brown-gray as the series went on.</p>, <p class="has-background has-accent-background-color"> The surname “Fisher” may class Elena as Christian, where references to fish often connote Jesus Christ as the “Fisher of Men.”<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Fish are also an Aryan aqueous resource in the JEM (one ingredient in <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/03/28/bread-as-an-important-example-of-the-consumption-motif/">the Consumption motif</a>). If perhaps a bit of a stretch, Elena’s hunt for news scoops can be interpreted as a reference to the Goddess of the Hunt, Artemis/Diana. All things considered Elena is a distinctly <em>non-Jewish</em> love interest, while Drake is akin to the seducing serpent in the Garden of Eden. Drake even engages in “<a href="https://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/11/28/the-neg-ing-jewish-husband-and-the-christian-wife/">neg-ing</a>” when he cruelly abandons Elena part way through their first adventure together.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> When they reunite she eventually forgives the betrayal, accepting that his aloofness is part of his roguish charm.</p>, <p>The sequel takes place sometime later when their relationship is on the rocks. In Elena’s absence Drake has teamed up with a fellow thief named <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Chloe_Frazer">Chloe Frazer</a>; she’s an <a href="https://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/02/27/the-bride-gathering-cult-part-vi-jewesses-as-leah-and-auxiliary-women/">auxiliary woman</a> – and they rekindle their romance. Her given name is a cognate of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demeter">Demeter/Ceres</a>, the Greco-Roman goddess of agriculture, itself a common archetype in the JEM associated with Aryans and fertility.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> This is emphasized by the surname <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frazer_(name)">Frazer</a>, which is “the Anglicized form of the Gaelic personal name Frasach (meaning) the generous/<strong>fruitful</strong> one.”<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3316">Chloe Frazer references Demeter/Ceres, the Greco-Roman goddess of the harvest.

Jeff is a potential rival for Elena’s affections, but he’s immediately eliminated when he’s shot and killed by some enemy soldiers. Thus we’re not terribly concerned if he was an Aryan or Semitic sexual competitor. What’s important is that with Jeff out of the picture, Druckmann has set up a love triangle between Drake, Elena, and Chloe. Given that Elena is a blonde, blue-eyed woman and Chloe is an Indian-European mix with black hair and tanned skin, no points for guessing who he ends up with. The bride gathering cult is, at its heart, a eugenics cult desiring Aryan features.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3317">Chloe and Elena meet in Uncharted 2.</p>, <p>Drake and Elena have more adventures together in the third game, get married, and by the end of the fourth game have a daughter named <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Cassie_Drake">Cassie</a>. She’s an example of the Cassandra archetype,<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> a character from Greco-Roman myth who rejects Apollo’s romantic advances. To be clear, the JEM archetype differs from the prevailing “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra_(metaphor)">Cassandra metaphor</a>.” The archetype is deployed to demoralize White men as Cassandra(s) reject them in favor of non-White sexual partners.</p>, <p>Hence Drake and Elena’s daughter Cassie, although just a child, has been set up to reject a White suitor in line with the archetype. This is the sort of subtle racial slights that Jews can incorporate into a story; should Cassie feature in future installments, I predict that she’ll be paired with a Jewish or non-White love interest.</p>, <p>In fact, there are two examples of the Cassandra archetype in the <em>Uncharted</em> series as <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Cassandra_Morgan">Drake’s mother</a> is also named Cassandra. Thus, we infer that she was an Aryan woman who chose to marry a non-Aryan man. This tells us that Drake inherited his Jewishness from his father, an arrangement not uncommon in the JEM,<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> which reinforces the notion that <a href="http://www.theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/02/03/the-bride-gathering-cult-part-iii-jews-the-greatest-of-the-admixed-types/">Jews are inherently admixed</a> while simultaneously corroborating Brahmin’s concept of the <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/02/05/the-chosen-bride-the-matrilineal-ruse/">matrilineal ruse</a>.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3318">Drake’s mother and daughter reference the Greco-Roman figure Cassandra, who famously denied Apollo’s advances. Note the subtly Jewish features of Cassie’s face. Her t-shirt shows a golden flame surrounding a blue lotus flower, an esoteric “blending” of the Jewish Fire God with an Aryan color symbol.</p>, <p>Drake’s mentor and father figure is the veteran thief <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Victor_Sullivan">Victor “Sully” Sullivan</a>. His given name is self-explanatory, but the nickname Sully means “south meadow,” where the South is typically understood as a non-Aryan realm (in contrast to the Hyperborean North). The same designation applies to the East versus the West, hence “Sully” seems to be a Semitic ally.</p>, <p>This is corroborated by the meaning of the Irish surname Sullivan, which stems from the basic word <em>súil</em> (lit. “eye”). The latter half of the name is contested; in full it can mean “one-eyed,” “quick eyed,” “little dark-eyed one,” or “hawk eyed.” This ambiguity is actually handy from the esotericist’s point of view, as the name can reference multiple mythological figures to convey Sully’s personality and archetype.</p>, <p>If Sullivan means “one-eyed,” he’s likely channeling the one-eyed Norse god Odin. However, if the name means “hawk eyed,” Sully is posing as the Arthurian wizard Merlin (there’s a species of pigeon-hawk called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(bird)">merlin</a>). Indeed Druckmann may be intelligently referencing both of these figures, who, like Sully, are wizened tricksters. Frequent references to <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2018/12/26/norse-myth-as-jewish-esoteric-moralization/">Norse myth</a> (handed down to us from the Church) and <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/01/24/arthurian-legend-as-deleterious-myth/">Arthurian legend</a> appear in the JEM, and these myths appear to hew closely to the symbol language. Later, we’ll see the odd reference built upon symbols from Incan mythology as well as Hinduism/Buddhism, but these are outliers/one-offs from my personal study of JEM.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3319">Victor “Sully” Sullivan is Drake’s mentor and partner in crime, a trickster like Odin and Merlin. Note the encoded Ouroboros symbol on the door in the background ( see my analysis of Annihilation for how it relates to JEM).</p>, <p class="has-background has-accent-background-color">Drake’s older brother <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Samuel_Drake">Samuel</a> is introduced in the fourth game. The sudden appearance of a down-on-his-luck older brother brings up an interesting motif in the JEM whereby siblings (especially brothers) may be <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/02/20/aryans-as-first-born-jews-as-second-born-the-curse-of-cain/"><em>racial rivals</em></a>.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> However, the name Samuel tends to be a Semitic identifier in the JEM so the Drakes don’t appear to follow this pattern. His Hebrew name means “God listened” or “God heard,”<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> suggesting God has answered Nathan’s prayers with Samuel’s reappearance.</p>, <p>The Biblical Samuel is the “king maker,” and Sam fits this role perfectly. Nathan has given up “treasure-hunting” (having married Elena) and is living a mundane existence; it is Sam’s return that coaxes Nathan into joining one last adventure. Sam surreptitiously collects some pirate gold during their quest, which is later used to purchase the company that Nathan works for (Nathan takes over as boss, becoming “king”). As a result, Nathan and Elena are set for life when they complete the treasure salvage in Malaysia that his former boss had been planning.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3320">Sam, the “king maker,” rescues his brother from his life of doldrums.</p>, <p>In <em>Uncharted: Among Thieves</em>, Drake befriends an old German explorer living in the Himalayas who was originally hired by the German National Socialists to find the entrance to <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Shambhala">Shambhala</a>. His name is <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Karl_Schäfer">Karl Schäfer</a>, which reveals that he’s another Semitic cipher. Characters named Karl and its cognates compose what Brahmin terms <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/03/15/the-frankish-motif-appearing-in-jem-jews-as-franks/">the Frankish motif</a>. His surname means “shepherd,” an occupation that aligns with Semitic archetypes such as Moses and <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/05/21/mercury-the-philosopher-priest-prophet-apostle-wizard-and-deceiver/">Hermes/Mercury</a>. As the latter was a “soul guide” to the Underworld or afterlife, Karl’s role is to guide Drake towards Shambhala, which is synonymous with Heaven or paradise.</p>, <p>It’s possible there’s another example of the Frankish motif in the third game, where we find the Englishman <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Charlie_Cutter">Charlie Cutter</a> (Charles is a cognate of Karl). Despite his Anglo-Saxon name and appearance, Charlie is Drake’s trustworthy brother-in-arms. His surname, originally an occupational name for a cloth cutter, may also suggest <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/04/08/jem-in-fairy-tales-and-european-folklore/">a woodcutter</a>. Wood is a symbol representing the Aryan as a consumable resource for the <a href="https://theapolloniantransmission.com/2018/12/23/semitic-earth-fire-gods/">Jewish Fire God</a>, wood that Charlie metaphorically “chops down” when killing foes.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>, <p>In the fourth game, we learn that Drake’s employer <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Jameson">Jameson</a> is married to a woman named Karla. It’s a minor detail for a character we’ll never meet, but it’s patterns like this that confirm the symbol language is at play. What’s important here is that these characters are Drake’s allies, which is why Brahmin suggests the Frankish empire was either Jewish, philo-Semitic, or inadvertently aligned with Jewish interests. We’ll see several historical references to anti-Semitic figures next, in the manner of <em>Indiana Jones</em>‘ <a href="https://lucasfilm.fandom.com/wiki/René_Emile_Belloq">Belloq</a> (a reference to the writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilaire_Belloc#Accusations_of_antisemitism">Hilaire Belloc</a>).</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3321">Karl Schäfer and Charlie Cutter, possible examples of the Frankish motif. Note that Charlie wears black and green, Semitic colors in the JEM symbolism.</p>, <p><a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Atoq_Navarro">Atoq Navarro</a>, a Peruvian Mestizos archeologist – and thus Drake’s treasure-hunting rival – is the main antagonist in the first game. His given name stems from Incan astronomy where a <a href="https://futurism.com/the-dark-constellations-of-the-incas">dark constellation</a> called Atoq represents the fox.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> The fox may function as a Semitic identifier related to the Teumessian Fox of Greco-Roman mythology, while the surname “Fox” and its cognates are also common Jewish names (note that Drake thinks Crash Bandicoot is a fox in <em>Uncharted 4</em>). In Incan mythology the fox is a thief that is said to have deceived the gods. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_mythology#Foxes">Wikipedia</a> states:</p>, <p>“(T)he deity Cuniraya Viracocha was angered by a fox and stated that, ‘As for you, even when you skulk around keeping your distance, people will thoroughly despise you and say ‘That fox is a thief!’ When they kill you they’ll carelessly throw you away and your skin too.’ In other narratives, the fox is said to have tried to steal the moon but the moon hugged the fox close which resulted in the spots on the moon.”<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>, <p>These details are thematically appropriate. The latter anecdote arguably posits Atoq as a Semitic figure <em>via</em> an association with <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/04/05/sin-as-an-original-jewish-god/">the Moon God Sin</a>.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> Alternatively the fox and Moon’s embrace dovetails with Atoq’s kidnapping of Elena, as she is associated with the Moon <em>via</em> the <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/07/08/the-daphne-motif-and-the-problem-with-laurels/">Artemis Daphnaia motif</a>.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>, <p>“Navarro” is a Spanish and Sephardi Jewish surname, further hinting that he’s a Semitic figure.

Note Atoq wears black (a Semitic color) while Roman wears white and blue (Aryan colors).</p>, <p>The tertiary villain is an Indonesian treasure hunter named <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Eddy_Raja">Eddy Raja</a>. Raja is an Indian name meaning “king,” where names indicating royalty commonly identify Aryan characters in the JEM.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> Thus despite his surface-level race, Eddy can be read as a historical reference to King Edward I, who famously issued the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Expulsion">Edict of Expulsion</a> in 1290. Hence he’s an inherently anti-Semitic villain! Indeed Raja manages to capture and imprison our hero, but Elena breaks Drake out of his prison cell (a bit like Oliver Cromwell “freeing” the Jews).</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3323">Eddy Raja is a reference to King Edward I. Note that he wears bright yellow and gold jewelry (Aryan colors/metal).</p>, <p class="has-background has-accent-background-color">The main villain in the second game is a Serbian war criminal named <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Zoran_Lazarević">Zoran Lazarević</a>. Zoran is a common Slavic name, the masculine form of Zora, which means “dawn” or “daybreak.” It comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorya">Zorya</a> of Slavic mythology, “the two guardian goddesses, known as the Auroras. . . the Morning Star and the Evening Star.”<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> To wit, Druckmann is drawing a line between these Slavic goddesses and their Greco-Roman counterparts Eos/Aurora (the Goddess of Dawn), and Hesperus/Venus (the Evening Star). Indeed the Slavic name Zora is etymologically linked to Zohra, the <em>Islamic</em> name for the Planet Venus!</p>, <p>Saliently the masculine form of the name is linked to Lucifer (also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer">the dawn-bringer</a> and Morning Star). Brahmin argues that <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/05/30/esoteric-apollo-lucifer-an-imperfect-name-describing-an-aryan-god/">Lucifer</a> is an epithet for Apollo,<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> implying Zoran is a god-masked Apollo. The smoking gun? Zoran’s official bio in <em>Uncharted 4</em> informs us that he had a “love for the writings of Neitzsche,” whose philosophy famously proposed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche#Apollonian_and_Dionysian">Apollonian Dionysian dichotomy</a>. That Apollo is repeatedly vilified as the personification of the “anti-Semitic Aryan” by Jewish authors is one of several reasons why Brahmin suggests we should <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/05/03/why-apolloism-is-3-0-2/">embrace Apollo</a> as our representative God.</p>, <p>The Serbian surname Lazarević is derived from the Hebrew name אֶלְעָזָר (<em>Elʿazar</em> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleazar"><em>Eleazar</em></a>), meaning “God has helped,” likely because Zoran manages to obtain the power of the story’s MacGuffin in the finale (though Drake still manages to defeat him). This heals Zoran’s burn scars which covered part of his face (an allusion to a fateful encounter with the <a href="https://theapolloniantransmission.com/2018/12/23/semitic-earth-fire-gods/">Jewish Fire God</a>, perhaps?). Alternatively the surname may describe Apollo as naturally gifted.</p>, <p>As a Serbian war criminal we can assume that Zoran is guilty of ethnic cleansing. This is likely a veiled criticism of the Apollo Cult’s eugenic <a href="https://theapolloniantransmission.com/2018/12/22/the-cult-of-apollo-part-i-a-eugenics-cult/">Thargelia rituals</a>, yet constitutes what Brahmin calls <a href="https://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/10/16/cep-conscious-ethnic-projection-in-jewish-religion-art-politics-and-life/">Conscious Ethnic Projection</a> (CEP) given Israel’s crimes against the Palestinians.

Here the stone is depicted as a blue orb in the center of a white tree referred to as the Tree of Life. The sphere’s blue coloration, which matches the sky and the Aryan’s blue eyes, indicates it is an Aryan power source.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> This plot device strikingly communicates the bride gathering cult’s obsession with the Aryan as a rejuvenating genetic resource. Given its color, power, shape, and position within the tree, this MacGuffin is the physical manifestation of the Tiferet, the sixth Sephira on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(Kabbalah)">Tree of Life</a> representing the planet Jupiter in Jewish mysticism.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3325">The Cintamani Stone in the Hindu/Buddhist Tree of Life, a stand-in for the Kabbalistic Tree of Life.</p>, <p>Zoran’s left-hand man is the treaure hunter <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Flynn">Harry Flynn</a>.

This is an allusion to the <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/04/11/illuminated-confirmed/">Illuminati</a>,<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> and corroborates Brahmin’s observation that the JEM outs <a href="https://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/04/07/historical-crypto-jews-identified-in-jem-and-history-as-propaganda/">historical crypto-Jews</a>.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> This also seems to apply to the game’s mention of <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/T._E._Lawrence">T.E. Lawrence</a> (a.k.a. Lawrence of Arabia) whose surname is cognate with Stephen (these identify Semitic ciphers in the JEM). Here the age of the Order may imply an Aryan organization due to the symbolism of <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/the-parabolists-quick-reference-guide-for-creating-aim/">the number four</a>, though typically the Illuminati/Freemasons are depicted as subordinate to Jewish interests.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40"><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>, <p>The surname Marlowe is a habitational name for someone who lived in Morlaix, Brittany, a peninsula in the northwest of France. This may indicate her family (or the Order itself) came with the Norman Invasion of England in 1066. Alternatively the name Morlaix sounds like <em>mort lait</em> which is French for “dead milk.” Jewish esotericists may imply “the milk has gone sour” or “has run dry” with such female characters.<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> Just as the crone represents the end of the life cycle, the implication here is that Zionist Freemasonry has “run its course” or has become corrupted.</p>, <p>As Katherine appears to have been consciously developed within the JEM framework, it seems likely that Druckmann conceived her. In contrast, Marlowe’s second-in-command is a man simply named Talbot, which means “messenger of destruction.” It seems to me that <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Talbot">Talbot</a> is one of Hennig’s creations, named in homage of David Talbot, the head of a similar secret society in Anne Rice’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Body_Thief"><em>The Tale of the Body Thief</em></a>. Hennig had previously worked on games starring vampires, so it follows that she’d be a fan of Rice’s work.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3327">Katherine “Kate” Marlowe is likely an allusion to Hecate/Trivia, a witch-like archetype in the JEM. Sister Catherine, seen briefly in Uncharted 4, is another example. She’s a strict nun who watches over the young Drake during his stay at a Catholic orphanage.</p>, <p>Druckmann was back in the driver’s seat for the fourth game. Here we find an imaginary villain named <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Hector_Alcázar">Hector Alcázar</a>. In Brahmin’s estimation Hector – the legendary Trojan killed by Achilles – is a Semitic figure.<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> The Spanish surname is a word for a type of Moorish castle or palace, as well as a habitational name for someone from Spain, suggesting perhaps Sephardi Jewish roots (indeed Hector looks as though he could be Drake’s father!). Alternatively, it may suggest the infamous <a href="http://castlemania.i11.co/alcatras.html">island prison Alcatras</a>, as Sam supposedly befriended Hector while the two were inmates in prison.</p>, <p>It is my suspicion that Alcázar, as “Butcher of Panama,” is a historical reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Noriega">Manuel Noriega Moreno</a>. “Moreno” is a Spanish, Portuguese, and Sephardi Jewish surname, possibly a derivative of the classical Latin “Maurus” meaning “Moor” (which would tie into the aforementioned meaning of Alcázar). Perhaps Druckmann is telling us that Noriega was a Jew. Alternatively Noriega’s ties to the United States intelligence agencies made him a puppet, an “imaginary villain,” just like Alcázar. This relates to Brahmin’s concept of the Caducean phenomenon.</p>, <p>The real villain is a White man named <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Rafe_Adler">Rafe Adler</a>. His given name (pronounced like “safe”) has multiple origins, the most likely being the Old Norse variant which means “counsel of the wolf,” or “wise wolf.” The wolf is an <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/05/07/esoteric-apollo-the-totem-of-wolf-as-pseudo-praise/">animal totem</a> commonly assigned to Aryan characters in the JEM.<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> Here it is paired with a German surname that means “eagle.” This is revealing, as both the wolf and the eagle are among Zeus/Jupiter’s sacred animals. Thus at bare minimum Adler is a clearly defined Aryan villain, if not a god-masked Zeus (Zeus is an Aryan god hated for having exiled <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2020/02/20/saturn-a-form-of-the-jewish-god-seven-a-reference-to-saturn/">Saturn</a> and <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/04/27/vulcan-as-an-important-form-of-the-lesser-god/">Vulcan</a>, the latter two being important Semitic deities in the JEM).</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3328">Nadine Ross and Rafe Adler in Uncharted 4.</p>, <p>A black woman named <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Nadine_Ross">Nadine Ross</a> is Adler’s accomplice. Her given name is of Arabic origin meaning “<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/admonitory">admonitory</a>/messenger,” which is contradicted by its secondary meaning of “Showerer of blessings.” Thus she’s indicated as neither good nor evil, or someone between an ally and a villain. Indeed she does not seem terribly concerned with killing Drake, and would later star in the spin-off <em>Uncharted: Lost Legacy</em> alongside Chloe as her partner in crime.</p>, <p>Her surname may descend from the Gaelic word for “headland,” which is “a narrow piece of land that projects from a <strong>coastline</strong> into the sea.” This clearly relates to her paramilitary outfit “Shoreline.” It can also mean “a strip of land left unplowed at the end of a field,” which implies she is neither sexually penetrated nor inseminated, i.e. a virgin.</p>, <p>These clues imply that Nadine is a god-masked Athena Parthenos, virgin goddess of war (and one of Zeus’ children). More specifically, as a black woman Nadine appears to venerate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Bernal">Martin Bernal</a>‘s (discredited) theory of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Athena">Black Athena</a>,” which is based on Plato’s notion that Athena was originally inspired by the “war-like” Egyptian goddess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neith">Neith</a>.</p>, <p>Moreover these meanings imply Nadine is a lesbian: In the JEM symbolism, water represents the Aryan as an aqueous resource, so if “Ross” means something like “peninsula,” Nadine is posited as the hard, masculine, earthen element penetrating the sea. The sexual connotation of “unplowed field” still applies as fully compatible with lesbianism.<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> Athena mourned the accidental killing of her beloved friend Pallas by taking her name, becoming “Pallas Athena,” the implication being they were more than friends. Indeed an official holiday illustration depicts Nadine and Chloe blushing under the mistletoe.</p>, <p>Often JEM takes the form of a parable where important historical conflicts are reduced to <a href="http://www.theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/03/14/the-parabolist-law-of-microcosm-the-definition-of-a-god/">a microcosm</a>. Let’s explore a simple example from <em>Uncharted 4</em>, when Drake spends some time in a Panamanian prison. This section of the game begins with a fist fight between him and a Spanish-speaking prisoner named Gustavo. “Gustavo” is the Spanish version of the Old Swedish name “Gustaf,” meaning “staff of the Geats.” To wit, Drake’s conflict with this “Spanish” thug is a parable of the Jewish struggle for dominance in Visigothic Spain reduced to a microcosm.</p>, <p>The fight is interrupted by a crooked prison warden named <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Vargas">Vargas</a>, who’s a minor villain. His is a Spanish habitational name stemming from a knight named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid#Middle_Ages">Iván de Vargas</a> who “distinguished himself in the (re)conquest of Madrid,”<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> allowing Christians to supplant Muslims at the center of the city. The reader will be aware that Jews opened the gates to the <a href="https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2016/03/27/moorish-spain-a-successful-multicultural-paradise/">Moorish invasion of Spain</a>, so Vargas is yet another reference to an historical anti-Semitic villain. Both Gustavo and Vargas will meet their demise as Drake escapes – effectively a “dunk” on Catholic Spain, which is a sore spot for Jews due to the counter-Semitic measures taken during the Spanish Inquisition.</p>, <p>As we saw in <em>Uncharted 2</em>, names cognate with Henry often indicate a god-masked Apollo – Jewry’s archnemesis. This appears to be the case with Druckmann’s reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Every">Henry Avery</a>, a legendary pirate, in <em>Uncharted 4</em>. In the game’s plot we learn that Henry Avery founded a pirate utopia called Libertalia with the help of eleven other legendary pirates. The “twelve pirates” who pooled their gold together are possibly the deities of the Greco-Roman pantheon related to <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/03/11/the-zodiac-as-a-propaganda-coup-and-the-semitic-nature-of-greek-heroes/">the Zodiac</a>.<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46"><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>, <p>Henry tried to take the colony’s treasure hoard for himself, and poisoned the other pirates with the help of an accomplice named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tew">Thomas Tew</a>. This may represent Apollo supplanting the other gods to become the most important deity. However, he failed: Thomas stabbed Henry in the back in an attempt to take the treasure for himself. In the finale we learn that Henry and Thomas killed one another.</p>, <p>Characters named Tom are often Christ figures in the JEM where the apostle “Doubting Thomas” is considered the “twin of Christ” (indeed Thomas means “twin” in Hebrew).<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> Thus the rise and fall of Libertalia, with its ill-fated Apollo and Christ figures, may be a parable of Christ’s victory over Apollo and the collapse of the Ancient Roman Empire.<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> Of course, Christ was crucified by the Romans and so Thomas Tew never made it out alive, either.</p>, <p>However, there may also be an encoded political message here. Note the similarity between <a href="https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Henry_Avery">Henry Avery’s pirate sigil</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones society’s logo</a>. Iconography present in Henry’s mansion points to his organization being something akin to Freemasonry, which would apply to Skull and Bones. Also note that Skull and Bones was started by <em>two key figures</em>, and had <em>twelve</em> original members. Hence the game’s backstory may communicate that Skull and Bones was an Aryan movement attempting to rob America that collapsed due to the Christian beliefs of its members.</p>, <p>Skull and Bones (a.k.a. Order 322) is an important organization in American politics and one that seems to be referenced in films. Take <a href="https://youtu.be/UsoYwysCdfY?t=128">the famous football scene</a> from <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> for example, in which a luxury suite numbered 322 explodes. The stadium where this scene was filmed does not contain a suite with that number, suggesting the detail is a deliberate reference. See also the Prescott family (i.e. Prescott Bush, a member of Skull and Bones) in <em><a href="https://theapolloniantransmission.com/2020/01/17/the-hidden-meaning-of-life-is-strange-twin-peaks-the-eleusinian-mysteries-racial-esoteric-moralization-by-hugo-adrian/">Life is Strange</a></em>.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3329">Henry Avery, whom Drake refers to as a “paranoid psychopath,” has a golden harp in his mansion. The harp is one of Apollo’s symbols. Also note the sunbursts on the floor and the golden suns on the doors in the mansion, more Apollonian symbols. On the doors, beneath the sun, there’s an encoded Masonic compass which is missing its partner, the square.</p>, <p>There is much, much, more to explore, but for brevity’s sake I will highlight only a few examples. In many areas the correct path forward is subtly marked with yellow, which guides the player as if on a “yellow brick road.” Yellow, like gold, is an Aryan color corresponding with blond hair and the sun. Blue is also an Aryan color due to the Aryan’s blue eyes. Take note where blue and yellow are combined in props or costumes. <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/05/01/the-color-green-robin-hood-may-day/">Green</a>,<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> on the other hand, is a Semitic color, while “<a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/07/04/captain-marvel-part-ii-the-christian-kree-and-the-jewish-skrulls/">purple</a> is where an Aryan blue meets red, the color of vulnerability to admixture.”<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> Thus Drake wears a <strong>green</strong> shirt and Elena wears a <strong>purple</strong> shirt as they share dinner and a passionate kiss in <em>Uncharted 4</em>.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3330">Costume colors matching the esoteric racial identities and themes appear in this scene from Uncharted 4.</p>, <p class="has-background has-accent-background-color"> JEM number symbolism is also present (keep your eyes peeled for the number six), as is Hebraic gematria. For example, in <em>Uncharted 4</em> the Saint Francis cathedral – the orphanage where Drake stays as a boy – is addressed 1016. In Hebraic gematria, <a href="http://www.billheidrick.com/works/hgm5/hg1000.htm#1016">1016</a> corresponds to a Hebrew word meaning “what is redundant or overlapping.” This is a religious slight describing Christianity from a Jewish perspective. Other associations with 1016 appear in <a href="http://www.billheidrick.com/works/hgm3/hg0360.htm#366">366</a>, where we find “Alliance” (describing Drake and Sam or St. Francis as a crypto-Jew <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/05/24/the-logical-proof-of-jewish-control-of-the-church/">allied with the Catholic church</a>) and <a href="http://www.billheidrick.com/works/hgm3/hg0450.htm#456">456</a>, “an orphan; a fatherless child” (reflecting Drake’s childhood).</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3331">The Saint Francis cathedral is addressed 1016, corresponding to meaningful Hebrew words via gematria.</p>, <p>Eagle-eyed players could have a field day sifting out all of the JEM tropes. Perhaps the most noteworthy motif is the franchise’s general focus on flashy water effects. Throughout the series, Drake will navigate river rapids on a sea-doo, infiltrate a tanker as it’s tossed about at sea, escape a sinking cruise ship, and so on. Ostensibly Naughty Dog’s designers wanted to show off the technical power of the Playstation with their visual effects wizardry. Yet as mentioned earlier, <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/03/26/baptism-and-anointing-a-symbol-for-copulation-with-aryan-women/">water</a> (especially fresh water) is an important symbol representing the Aryan as an essential resource (Semites are a desert-dwelling people, after all).</p>, <p>That Naughty Dog’s games contain Jewish Esoteric Moralization raises serious concerns about Druckmann’s leadership. Dissidents will certainly want to boycott the company, but what about the studio itself? Can straight, White, Christian men working under his regime truly expect fair and equal treatment, given his deep-seated racial/religious bias? How many non-Jewish employees have been passed over for promotion, simply because they’re the “enemy”? And has he made any passes at blondes working there, such as the actresses he hires to portray his characters?</p>, <p>Of course until JEM becomes a widely known phenomenon Druckmann can deny and deflect with <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/03/01/names-part-ii-the-importance-of-names-in-rem-common-names-exoteric-alibis/">exoteric alibis</a>. Yet the scandal surrounding Amy Hennig’s departure from the company seems to be the clincher. As mentioned, despite her industry experience Hennig was allegedly “<a href="https://gamerant.com/naughty-dog-amy-hennig-forced-departure-uncharted/">forced out</a>” by Druckmann and Bruce Straley. This analysis reveals the likely motive: Her ideas were simply incompatible with the esoteric subtext Druckmann sought to insert! Hypothetically, he could <a href="https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/category/jewish-ethnic-networking/">rally his co-ethnic male peers</a> to his side but had to leave her in the dark. And so he and Straley allegedly “stonewalled” her, which must have been personally and professionally devastating to her.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3332">Three’s a crowd: Amy Hennig was allegedly forced out of the company by Neil Druckmann and Bruce Straley.</p>, <p>Hennig is a cut above most video game writers, but like most non-Jewish authors she probably thinks of her work as having no purpose beyond entertainment. It should be self-evident that the intricacy and purpose behind Druckmann’s work is, in its own way, impressive and imitable. If left unchallenged, he will no doubt become something like the Steven Spielberg or Stan Lee of video games. His other baby, <em>The Last of Us</em>, is widely acclaimed – despite its many shortcomings in game design – purely because of its production value and story.</p>, <p>Brahmin argues we must treat our own Art with the same care and respect because of its power to shape the culture and attitudes of our people. A “<a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/03/07/a-return-to-sophistication/">return to sophistication</a>,”<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> both in how we write stories and interpret them, will inevitably require “<a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/05/03/myth-and-symbol-language-part-i-the-importance-of-establishing-an-agreed-upon-shared-symbolism/">the establishment of an agreed upon, shared symbolism</a>.”<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> Race-conscious White writers can begin the process of <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2019/01/23/r-e-m-part-i-a-i-m-versus-j-e-m/">moralizing our people</a> by simply reversing the way in which Greco-Roman archetypes are deployed in the JEM (for some quick tips, <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/the-parabolists-quick-reference-guide-for-creating-aim/">click here</a>). Applying Roman Interpretation to Jewish art is an education in itself that will yield many important building blocks.</p>, <p>Lastly, I feel Sony should send in a Japanese task force to radically restructure Naughty Dog from top to bottom. This likely won’t happen, but the debacle surrounding <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> and its bizarre political agenda would provide the perfect cover for terminating Druckmann’s employment. Hennig could be invited back as the lead writer/director, which would signal a return to form while pleasing stalwart fans. At the very least Sony should audit the software marketed by former Naughty Dog employee Andrew Maximov called “<a href="https://www.prometheanai.com/">Promothean A.I.</a>” to determine if he has stolen any of the studio’s intellectual property. <a href="http://theapolloniantransmission.com/2018/12/23/the-promethean-and-atlatean-terribly-abused-and-misused-words/">Prometheus</a> is, after all, a Semitic figure who stole fire from the Gods.</p>, <p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Rubin directed the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Bandicoot"><em>Crash Bandicoot</em></a> games, which are legitimately good, as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_and_Daxter"><em>Jak &amp; Daxter</em></a> trilogy (which are solid if not spectacular).

Is this something that can be fully separated from radicals in our movement? Maybe not completely, however, just like the addict in the opium den, so too, are nationalists being consumed in reverie over any time period that they never lived in, and in place of progression is a great wheat field image induced stagnation that breeds depression and resentment.</p>, <p>Third position ideas do require reflection on our past, which can justifiably create immense admiration, but if only for the purpose of moving forward. Jewish Filmmaker Woody Allen, seems to understand the negative effects of nostalgia and seemingly gifts us with his 2011 film, Midnight In Paris. A film that displays how this trance-like state of yearning for the past can seriously complicate your present. The only problem is Allen, I feel, is speaking to a very specific audience and that audience is us. Thus, he is careful to not encourage us too much and, as you will read below, I believe he has a more nefarious purpose for this messaging.</p>, <p><strong>OVERVIEW OF MIDNIGHT IN PARIS</strong></p>, <p><strong> </strong>Midnight in Paris, written and directed by Woody Allen, is a quirky tale of a screenwriter seemingly at an impasse. Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), is vacationing in Paris with his fiancee, Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents John and Helen. As we can see right off the bat, Gil and Inez couldn’t be more different than one another. Gil is very lackadaisical while Inez is explicitly high maintenance and intense. Inez’s parents have nothing but disdain for Gil and his ostensibly aloof and unserious personality. Gil is almost finished with his first novel about a man working in a nostalgia shop. Inez is not impressed or encouraging with this novel and wishes he would stick to screenwriting due to to his success in Hollywood. Inez is also annoyed at Gils’ insistence that they should live in Paris indefinitely due to his nostalgic euphoria over the Paris of the 1920’s.</p>, <p>Paul, who is a friend of Inez, and his wife happen to be in Paris at the same time as them. She admits to Gil she had a “crush” on Paul in college to which a clearly jealous Gil describes him as “Pedantic” and “Pseudo-intellectual”. Inez is clearly infatuated with Paul while Gil cannot stand him. Paul is a very dapper man who speaks with confidence and with every chance he gets, he tries to be the smartest man in the room. Even when he is contradicted by a tour guide about the artist Rodin and his tryst with his wife and mistress, Paul will not relent and keeps insisting he is right (and as the viewer can find out if they look into the life of Rodin, the tour guide was correct).</p>, <p>Gil and Inez have a night of drinking with Paul and his wife until Gil opts for a walk around the city of Paris alone to take the city it all in while Inez leaves with Paul and his wife in a taxi. Gil stops on his walk to figure out where he is exactly and as soon as the clock strikes midnight, a 1920’s vehicle pulls up in front of Gil. The passengers, also dressed from the 20’s, invite him to join them. It is at this point Gil is transported back in time to what he sees as the Golden Age of Paris. The 1920’s. This allows for an entertaining list of famous characters from the time to enter the plot such as Ernest Hemingway, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, Cole Porter, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and more.</p>, <p>Every night Gil transports himself back in time to meet all these artistic giants of the 20th century while his wife spends her time with Paul and, supposedly, his wife. After Hemingway brings Gil to Gertrude Stein’s flat so that he may have his novel analyzed, he meets Adriana (Marianne Cotillard). They have an instant connection and Gil becomes conflicted with this new flame that he has in the past and his current fiancee.</p>, <p>After visiting an Antique vendor in the present day, he finds Adriana’s diary where she has written a passage about her love for Gil. This encourages him to go back in time once more so that they may communicate their feelings for one another. They do so,and as they kiss at midnight, a horse drawn carriage pulls up in front of them and a well dressed couple invites them in. They are then transported to the 1890’s which is the true Golden Age, according to Adriana. After she is offered a job to make costumes for the theater, she decides to stay but Gil cannot. He realizes that everybody is bored with the age in which they live and they won’t find their meaning by going back. He decides the present is where he should remain and they choose to part.</p>, <p>Once in the present, Gil realizes Inez may be cheating on him with Paul (a discovery made by Hemingway after he reads Gil’s novel; Gertrude Stein then relates to Gil that Hemingway could not believe the protagonist did not see his fiancee was having an affair right before his eyes with “the pedantic one”) and when he confronts her, she admits to doing so but that he needs to just “get over it”. Gil seems rather pleased and takes this moment to tell her he will stay in Paris and they are not right for one another. In the end, we see Gil walking, yet again, through the city of Paris and at midnight he bumps into a young beautiful antique vendor he met earlier in the film. They walk off together through the streets, in the rain, which is where Gil always felt happiest.</p>, <p><strong>WOODY ALLEN &amp; THE ARYAN</strong></p>, <p><strong> </strong>What does this film mean, and more importantly, what does it mean for nationalists? In a way, Allen is giving an honest critique of reactionary thought. Not living in the now and spending ones time only in the past can produce untold unhappiness in the present. Gil is frustrated with how he is presently living. He dreams of a before time when to him everything was great. We see this many a time in politics. For a typical Republican, perhaps it’s America in the 50’s. To some 1930s Europe. To others medieval times and there are even those that believe that in the days of cavemen things were far more ideal. Which ever time one finds themselves pining for, Allen is telling the viewer that it is the present we should be focused in but how exactly is he portraying the present?</p>, <p>The film opens with a series of static shots that appear almost like paintings to display the very best of Paris. Throughout the film, the city is always ever present as another character in the story. While indeed very inspiring and breathtaking, it is obvious Woody Allen has only picked very select parts of the city. What we know of Paris today is that it is a shell of its former self. Even in 2011, during the films release, migrant hell holes burrowed their way into the city along with the trash that covers the streets. Culture in Paris is waning and the very best parts of the city are only preserved for the sake of tourism and not for the French soul. I doubt Allen is ignorant to any this. Quite the opposite. I believe this was a calculated decision on his part to ensure that we don’t spend much time in the past but to also accept our present as being more than sufficient, therefore we have no need to look to our future. As Nationalists, we are inspired by our past which Allen is more than aware, and as I’ve stated before we take elements from our Golden Age (whenever that may be) so that we may apply it to our lives in order to create a different future than the one that has been currently decided for us. Allen is careful to not encourage us too much. He wants you to stay forever in the present and to imprison your passion within the confines of a “this is good enough” type of attitude.</p>, <p>How do we know Allen is speaking to us? Some subtle clues in his body of work, as well as Midnight in Paris specifically, give us an indication of who he is speaking to. One of the ways we can find these clues is through name recognition which you can learn through the work of Mark Brahmin and his work in Jewish Esoteric Moralization also known as JEM. Many Jewish filmmakers pick very specific names in order to indicate who is an “Aryan” and who is a “Jew”. Gil can be translated to a few different meanings. Foolish, simpleton, and happy (which can hint at a happiness out of ignorance) are among those meanings which makes sense when you view this blonde and blue eyed character in the film. JEM often portrays the Aryan figure as gullible and generally oblivious.</p>, <p>It’s not that Gil is an ignorant man by any means it is more that he is a bit unaware of his surroundings and can be easily manipulated. Two women in his life that are Jewish signifiers, Inez (Who’s father is a Jewish figure named John who is also a neocon) and Adriana (meaning black, which is a Jewish signifier), merely have Gil around for their temporary entertainment. Adriana, for example, writes in her diary that her reasons for loving Gil are that he is “naive and unassuming”. Paul Bates, being short for Bartholomew which is a Jewish signifier, even cuckolds Gil. The Jewish figure steals the Aryans woman away from him.</p>, <p>While there are several symbols and other names that we can delve into, the point is that Allen is giving, in my opinion, a direct message to the “goy”. Jews are very fearful of an inspired Aryan people which may lead to uprisings as we have seen in the past. Since film is possibly the most versatile art form in history, it would behoove one such as Woody Allen to not only entertain his audience but to also influence them in a way that he feels benefits him through subversive means.</p>, <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>, <p>Nostalgia, while being quite natural, can be a trap. Gil experienced this well enough. While its aroma can be alluring, it has been the great motivator of inaction among Nationalists currently. I cannot emphasize enough that we can, and should, look to days gone by to find inspiration and ideas that we can use or even update to create a future. But A movement must have vision. Vision requires forward thinking. There is no return to tradition and Nostalgia is by no means meant to be our end goal.</p>, <p>Midnight in Paris interested me because on one hand Woody Allen is acting as if he is giving us good advice on this matter. On the other hand, making sure we are stopped in our tracks. This is one of many ways our opposition tries to control us. The film is well done, entertaining, and quite funny. With that being said, Allen wishes to make you feel like you are progressing while in reality keeping you in a perpetual hamster wheel. It is all too Caducean.

It is a widely held belief that political change arises organically from the bottom, but many a great scholarly work (C.A. Bond’s <em>‘Nemesis’ </em>and Christopher Caldwell’s <em>‘The Age of Entitlement’</em>, for example) utterly demolish this faulty perception.  Nothing has ever occurred, whether we speak of the American Revolution, the Bolshevik Revolution, Mussolini’s or Napoleon’s rise to power, to use some recent examples, without the patronage of the upper classes.  The extremist capture of the United States is no exception.  Before we may begin, I must credit some of these insights to the work of Polish psychiatrist Andrzej Lobaczewski, who, after collecting several decade’s worth of work studying the psychology of totalitarian regimes (in particular the USSR), published them in 2006 in a book titled <em>‘Political Ponerology: A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes’.</em></p>, <p>In his book, Lobaczewski described a ‘<em>hysteroidal cycle’</em> whereby the privileged classes transmit maladaptive attitudes and behaviors over the course of multiple generations, the final result of which is a phenomenon he termed <em>‘macrosocial dysfunction’</em>.  Put succinctly, the dysfunctions of the few (the privileged classes) become the dysfunctions of the many (everyone else).  These hysteroidal cycles consist of alternating durations of ‘happy times’ and ‘unhappy times’, where, in the former, moral and psychological knowledge pertaining to issues of psychopathology is suppressed, while the latter represents an excavation and exploration of this previously forbidden trove of knowledge.  The subsequent recovery of this knowledge is then used to rectify problems created by the hoarding of this information.</p>, <p>Lobaczewski views social injustice as integral to the perpetuation of mass psychological dis-ease, seeing as, in his view, the upper classes necessarily exploit the lower classes in order to attain (and preserve) their wealth and good fortune (The happiness and prosperity of this first phase of the cycle itself may be predicated on the suppression and persecution of some minority group, or the under classes more broadly).  Through conversive and hysterical reasoning, these privileged classes selectively perceive information in such a way that they can more easily justify profiting from their ill gotten gains and marginalizing the moral, mental, and labor values of those they exploit.  Each subsequent generation suffers from a progressive <em>“atrophy of natural critical faculties”</em> (p. 170) which ultimately culminates in the censorship, persecution, and even genocide of those underprivileged classes, whose very existence challenges the pathological worldview of the privileged.</p>, <p>Control of the psychologically normal is achieved first by the embedding of a <em>“pathologically hypersensitive censor”</em> (p. 177) within the citizenry themselves.  These are in effect, ego defenses deployed by the upper classes who seek to preserve their own positive self-image.  It is these defects of the ego, in the form of <em>“egoism, egotism, and egocentrism” </em>(p. 177) which are the root psychological causes of what he terms <em>characteropathic</em> <em>failings</em>.  Moreover, not only will these privileged classes adopt pathological – and ultimately violent – attitudes toward those they rule, but they will even develop contempt and antagonism toward competing nations that adhere to a healthier and more psychologically integrated approach in their governance.  (We may easily look at the present day United States and see a manifestation of what Lobaczewski describes; the American upper classes regularly castigate their constituents for their moral failings, their lack of sophistication, et cetera, all the while decrying other nations which, however imperfectly they may be achieved, work far more diligently to protect and provide for their people.  Countries such as Hungary, Poland, Russia, Iran, and China come to mind immediately).</p>, <p>In Lobaczewski’s ponerological model, a society is comprised of two essential psychological types: The characteropathic and the normal.  Characteropaths are those individuals who suffer some biological condition (such as brain trauma) or genetic predisposition (for example, a personality disorder) and are thus given to a psychological disposition of evil.  Whether they are the progenitors of such evil or merely the lackeys who happily execute the evil will of others is of little consequence.  We may call these types <em>maladapts.  </em>The ‘normals’ are greater in number than the maladapts, and have an innate moral character in addition to a well-adapted psychological profile, but are often incapable of recognizing (or even properly resisting) this psychology of evil due to their naïve condition.</p>, <p>Any institution can find itself infiltrated by maladapts who then work to bend that institution to their will, which in turn signals a fertile ground for other maladapts and <em>pathocrats</em> to gain entry (pathocrats being defined as any political actor given to a psychology of evil).  It is the nature of the characteropath to exploit structural weaknesses in an organization so that he may overtake it, turning it to his own diabolical purposes.  Should he fail it would be his death; if the characteropath cannot ascend to the role of pathocrat, he would either wash out of society due to his own weakness and lack of social utility or be driven out by those members of polite society who have become wise to his game.  We may say then that subversion and domination are among the defining traits of the characteropath.  They are a biological type who cannot thrive under normal conditions – they must destroy what is good and healthy in order to live.  Fortunately for us, Lobaczewski argues that <em>“the pathocracy’s dominance will weaken imperceptibly but steadily, finally leading to a situation where in the society of normal people reaches for power. This is a nightmare vision to the psychopaths. That the biological, psychological, moral, and economic destruction of the majority of normal people becomes, for the pathocrat, a biological necessity.”</em> (p. 208).  The essential civilizational struggle, in Lobaczewski’s view, lies between ‘the normal people’ and the pathocrats; it is a conflict which has occurred in every civilization for as long as human societies have existed and will persist for as long as our species draws breath.</p>, <p>As I have noted already, Lobaczewski looks to the sciences of biology and genetics to find the origin of the characteropath.  It is of interest to note that Lobaczewski was among the last class of psychiatrists to be trained in these disciplines before the Soviets censored them and restricted the discipline to the study of Pavlovian concepts.  (Here we see a clear bit of historical proof for Lobaczewski’s argument).  While the science of psychopathology has progressed a great deal since Lobaczewki’s time as a student (and there still remains a great deal of disagreement over the proper diagnostic criteria for many of these conditions), I will reproduce his findings as he described them so that the reader may appreciate them in their full and unadulterated context.  Primarily, Lobaczewski connects the biological dimension of the characteropath’s psychopathology to a condition of <em>schizoidia</em>.  The schizoid is recognized by an acute hypersensitivity and characteristic distrustfulness; they are inattentive to the emotions of others, quickly adopt extreme positions, and retaliate harshly (and immediately) for perceived slights against them.  Typically eccentric, they are prone to projecting <em>(“superimposing”</em> in Lobaczewski’s words) <em>“erroneous, pejorative interpretations of other people’s intentions”</em> (p. 123).  In simpler terms, they are quick to malign others without sufficient reason for doing so.  They are drawn to moral causes, although they <em>“actually inflict damage upon themselves and others”</em> (p. 123).  Owing to their impoverished worldview, they are overly pessimistic and misanthropic with regards human nature.  Schizoids have a <em>“dull pallor of emotion”</em> and <em>“consider themselves intellectually superior to ordinary people”</em> (p. 124).  Interestingly, Lobaczewski points out that, demographically speaking, schizoids are represented most numerously among Jews (elsewhere, and repeatedly, Lobaczewski observes the overrepresentation of Jews among these pathocratic types).</p>, <p>However, we should not limit our concern to these dysfunctional individuals alone.  Exposure to these types who exhibit dysfunctional personalities can twist the minds of a normal person, capturing them in the vortex of their mental illness, not unlike a starship caught in the tractor beam of some intergalactic warmonger.  Proximity to characteropaths, then, is as great a risk to the average person as their mere existence is.  The pathocrat is a natural parasite who can only thrive in an environment that is explicitly hostile to the needs and demands of the average person.  As such, characteropaths frantically work to pervert the organizations they join by manipulating and distorting language so as to provide cover for their true intentions.  The characteropath sets himself up as an integral member of the institution, enshrining himself as a necessary priestly type who may then provide the ideological weight for the yet-to-be-adopted belief system.  Where these individuals (to use Lobaczewski’s phrase, <em>“spellbinders”</em>) are unable to directly influence and redirect the energies of a given organization, they will form alliances with more charismatic types who may themselves be less pathological, or simply possess an earthier charm and personal magnetism that allows them to capture the imagination of a people, even without any kind of intellectual or ideological acumen to support his campaign.</p>, <p>Often, these pathocrats are able to attract less dysfunctional types (Lobaczewski calls them <em>“skirtoids”</em>), who dutifully execute their dictates and assist in maintaining the new moral infrastructure.  These skirtoids <em>“are vital, egotistical, and thick-skinned individuals who make good soldiers because of their endurance and psychological resistance.  In peacetime, however, they are incapable of understanding life’s subtler matters or rearing children prudently.  They are happy in primitive surroundings; a comfortable environment easily causes hysterization within them.  They are rigidly conservative in all areas and supportive of governments that rule with a heavy hand.”</em>  (p. 136).  These psychopaths (pathocrats), often being physically incapable of enacting the methods they propagate through oral and written sophistry, are heavily reliant on these skirtoids and a third type, which he calls <em>“jackals”</em>.  These individuals are <em>“hired as professional and mercenary killers by various groups and who so quickly and easily take up arms as a means of political struggle; no human feelings interfere with their nefarious plans.”</em> (p. 136).   But Lobaczewski stops at the point of categorizing these types as fitting within either the skirtoidal or psychopathic dimensions of psychopathology, but rather suggests that <em>“we should assume this type to be a product of a cross between lesser taints of various deviations.”</em> (p. 136). Furthermore, he states <em>“mate-selection psychology produces pairings which bilaterally represent various anomalies.  Carriers of two or even three lesser deviational factors should thus be more frequent.  A jackal could then be imagined as the carrier of schizoidal traits in combination with some other psychopathy, e.g. essential psychopathy or skirtoidism.” </em>(p. 136).</p>, <p>It is critical for these pathocratic spellbinders to nudge the normal majority away from what Lobaczewski calls its <em>“congenital instinctive infrastructure”</em> (p. 60).  He repeatedly emphasizes the necessity for the <em>“common sense”</em> (p. 188) of the normal majority to prevail in order for a society to maintain its moral center and to thrive intellectually, creatively, economically, and spiritually.  To separate the majority from their common sense, the spellbinder employs the use of doubletalk as his chief strategy for nudging people away from their natural instincts.  The process of ponerization (the overcoding of a society’s moral structure from moral to immoral) necessitates a dual semantic layer, wherein the outer layer is used rhetorically against the target while the inner layer reinforces membership among those psychopaths embedded within the power structure.  In effect, these differing meanings serve to re-stratify the classes of a ponerogenic culture.  The spellbinders (and their collaborators) immediately recognize its hermeneutic meaning; it is only after prolonged exposure (and great labor on the part of the masses) that the targets of this ponerogenic speech are ever availed of its true meaning.  To put this in our current context, we may look at certain phrases (e.g., <em>“Diversity is our strength”</em>) and understand how the meaning differs depending on who utters it (diversity may be a strength for the spellbinder, but as Robert Putnam argued in his 2000 publication, “<em>Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community” </em>it proves to be a problem for those outside of the spellbinding class).</p>, <p>I have made this point already but it bears elaboration: Innately these spellbinders are people who cannot function in a healthy society, and moreover, feel wronged by it.  As part of their paranoid ideations, they perceive themselves as marginalized and persecuted (although in a certain sense they are correct, given their predilection for manipulation and harm, the natural response is one of ostracism).  The narcissism and self-absorption of the psychopath leads him to create a kind of hero myth that justifies his own actions (if not to himself than to those he seeks dominion over).  By necessity, the characteropath casts himself as a savior – as one who has graciously taken up the causes of liberation and nobility.  This approach proves advantageous for him if he operates within a society where actual injustice is present and easily identifiable (which is usually the case).  Lobaczewski points out that these types construct ideological unions which are predicated upon 1) the exaltation of a wronged other, 2) the radical redressing of that wrong, and 3) the higher values of the characteropathic individuals who have usurped the organization.</p>, <p>Individual psychological failings (be they psychopaths, or abnormal and deficient in some other way) are then moralized into a revolutionary credo that gives them just cause for retribution, thus providing sufficient motivation to deny any self-examination.  Were this technique not so repugnant, one could admire its ingenuity; the moral wickedness of their conduct (which would surely be apparent to any outsider, were it stripped of its romanticism and paramoralisms) is neatly excused and then expelled.  Such a practice is especially important for counteracting the functional conscience in those with a more typical psychological profile.  The fact that true injustice <em>does</em> exist, and that this new ideology <em>claims to resist it</em> means that inductees into this new culture will be more easily swayed into rationalizing the spellbinder’s doubletalk, and never question its truer esoteric meaning.  Naturally, there is more to this story – and 21<sup>st</sup> century America is very different from the Soviet Republic of the last century.  I will address these differences in a moment.  For now, let us look once more at this phenomenon of spellbinding.</p>, <p>For the skeptical reader, we can dispel with the fanciful terminology and simply look to the very real circumstances we observe in our current situation.  Take the language of victimization and its myriad expressions – racism, sexism, xenophobia, transphobia, homophobia, islamophobia, ableism, to name a few.  Let us begin with the use of the term ‘racism’: Initially, the word was used to describe an irrational and seething hatred of other races.  Those noble of heart and sensitive to the plight of, say, African-Americans, knew in their souls that they did not harbor animosity toward Blacks and therefore willingly acclimated to the changing cultural and political dialectics.  But as per the hermeneutic tradition of the spellbinder, the term came to take on a new meaning – that of power and privilege.  The eternal revolt against racial discrimination required a new meaning for a new time, against a new generation of foes.  Now, to be racist no longer means being an unsophisticated bigot, full of hatred; instead, it means to enjoy the privilege of cultural, historical, and political continuity.  To be a racist in 21<sup>st</sup> century America is to hold power, unearned power, over the dispossessed other.   In one sense, that power is one of an unbroken continuity of being – but in a more immediate and political sense it is about institutional hegemony.  Whites, being privileged, now find themselves swimming in a racist undercurrent, where every action, every errant glance, each thoughtless utterance is actually a demonstration of sinister, unjustifiable power and racial superiority that must be deconstructed.  As the usage of this term and the ability to affect political and cultural change based on the desire to annihilate racism grows, more Americans find themselves scratching their heads at the new power this term wields.  <em>“How is that racist?  That doesn’t make sense.  I don’t hate Blacks or Hispanics.”</em>  And likely they don’t.  Only one no longer has to hate non-Whites in order to be racist, one merely has to <em>exist</em> in order to be racist.  The jargon of pathocratic psychopathy has thus emerged from its cocoon different, changed, and now more powerful than when it first appeared.</p>, <p>Sexism worked in this way too; the willful discrimination and marginalization of women meant something far different a few decades ago.  Whereas any social role that was denied to women was understood to be sexist, now any circumstance which affects women <em>differently </em>is evidence of sexual discrimination and oppression.  With such an elastic definition, instances of racism and sexism now explode with regularity.  Similarly with homophobia, islamophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and the like, the spellbinding hermeneutics of prejudice grant more power to the characteropath and further oppress the normal and the psychologically fit.  Of particular insidiousness is the use of the suffix ‘phobia’; the use of a clearly understood medical and psychiatric terminology, ‘phobia’ has been grafted to a sociopolitical system of linguistics that overcodes an entire range of cognitions and affects, reducing them to a singular phenomena – fear – the use of which now paints anyone who demonstrates anything other than unflinching support (and submission) towards an underprivileged group could be considered fearful, despotic, and mentally ill.</p>, <p>A new meaning for millennia old biological and evolutionary normalcy’s was created to psychologically wound average people who are not nearly as Machiavellian and sinister as those spellbinders responsible for creating this new moral-linguistic landscape.  A whole range of emotional responses (e.g., disgust, confusion, reticence, self-preservation, et cetera) are no longer legitimated for anyone outside of the spellbinding class, and especially for those unwilling to subjugate themselves to it.  It is difficult to overstate the effect this has on the mind – by constantly changing the moral language and rules of social engagement, consciousness is split, and new sub-personalities are created which now exist in a constant state of conflict.  Not only do these terms create a new moral, linguistic, and affective landscape, but they also radically redraw the sociopolitical structure, creating new castes of privileged and unprivileged members, and allotting people to these new classes based on their willingness to conform to an ever-changing set of demands.</p>, <p>Another example would be the constantly evolving charge of anti-Semitism.  Clearly, it was once understood that claims of anti-Semitism were intended to characterize attitudes and conduct that were explicitly (and perhaps even implicitly) discriminatory or hostile toward Jewish people.  Presently, (and much like the plastic definition of racism) it is now used to designate <em>any</em> othering of Jews, be it negative or positive.  And so, folded into the original meaning of these terms (hatred and fear) is any impulse toward differentiation (another ‘common sense’ instinct as Lobaczewski would say).  Interestingly, the very use of the term is curious because it creates a cleavage in the Gentiles understanding of who precisely <em>is</em> a Semite.  Anti-Semitism is fundamentally about anti-Jewish sentiment, but the term Semite is a cultural, linguistic, ethnic, and racial designation that encompasses a far broader grouping of peoples than simply that of the Jewish individual.  Once more we see how spellbinders use language to fracture and limit the cognitive abilities of the average person.</p>, <p>The originators of these spells create the circumstances by which a healthy society is carved up under the new rules of engagement.  But as I have already pointed out, their progeny merely inherit this system of rules and logic, often without any insight into its genesis.  This phenomenon is not unlike the transmission of rituals and taboos, whereby people unthinkingly inherit these dictums but are oblivious to their intention, and so merely act on them in rote, unconscious fashion.  This is how psychopathic tendencies are transmitted intergenerationally – at first as an intentional means of control, and then merely as a commonplace and thoughtless habit, not unlike how one washes up after themselves.  The situation becomes far worse for the inheritors of this system, as they merely acquire these attitudes through the mechanisms of conditioning and modeling.  They are indoctrinated into a pathological worldview which dictates every relationship they enter, every career they take up, each choice and each breath.  Children don’t just inherit the material or biological traits of their parents, but also their ideological ones (particularly the farther one goes up the socioeconomic ladder, where the stakes are higher).  Of course, these conditions are guaranteed to degenerate over time, as the inheritors of this system possess none of the insight, none of the self-awareness of their forbears, and are subsequently left with fewer psychological tools with which to manage themselves or their pathological reactions.  While they may acquire their power second-hand, it comes with a litany of irrational and hysterical impulses which can neither be contextualized nor dissipated.  Heavy indeed is the head that wears the crown.  Naturally psychopaths wound themselves with their psychological contortions, ego defenses, and general anti-social conduct.  We understand very easily as well that they wound those who are made the targets of their pathology.  But what is less well understood is how those around them, their wives, husbands, children, nieces and nephews, too, are victimized by their pathological and misanthropic outlook.  Their impoverished psychological worldview becomes a mental prison that their kin rarely, if ever, escapes.  Worse still, those that do escape become permanent outcasts, as they – not unlike cult members – have broken out of an inter-generational cycle of psychopathy only to find little in the way of community outside of it.  However, it should be said that they often end up worse than cult members.  In many cases, these individuals lose affiliations of race, religion, social class, and more personally, blood relations.  It is difficult to quantify just which is worse for such individuals – the spellbinding that keeps them in a state of conformity or the ostracism they suffer as a result of breaking free.  Each outcome is tragic in its own way.</p>, <p>It is not uncommon to come across people (even in the online dissident sphere) who believe that the upper classes are made up of individuals with relatively typical psychological profiles.  This is not to say that they are <em>just like us, </em>but it is a kind of reflexive unwillingness to entertain the possibility – neigh, the existence – of evil.  Such individuals may rationalize away the failures of leadership or even identify with their plight.  There are some who believe in the existence of a <em>One Weird Trick For Solving Political Strife</em>, whereby all that is required to solve the problems confronting the over-class is to provide them with a better system or a better deal.  I cannot in good conscience endorse this worldview.  We simply know too much about the nature of the psychopathy and its prevalence among the leadership classes (Robert Hare and Hervey Cleckley have both written extensively on the over-representation of psychopathy among corporate and political leadership).  All of this is not to say that every leader is a dastardly, mustache-twirling loon, or even that every psychopath presents a clear and present danger to the social order (psychopathy is defined by a variety of traits, and it is not necessarily the case that the psychopath is malevolent; often they merely lack that positive social feeling more commonly found among the normal population), but what I am saying is that these individuals are not, by and large, a class to be reasoned with.  A sober analysis (such as the one I have provided) puts us in a superior position to organize and develop effective strategies for advancing <em>our </em>political aims, and not the aims of those who view us with contempt.</p>, <p>Andrzej Łobaczewski, Political Ponerology: A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes, (Grande Prairie: Red Pill

Prior to 2020, he was known near exclusively by a sole biography on Francis Parker Yockey, <em>Dreamer of the Day</em>, and any conspiracy of the following sort would have been considered gauche.  Almost immediately after his passing The New York Times released a laudatory obituary of the man.  Their hosting memoirs from figures like Uma Zykofsky<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> – a Deputy Director for the State of California<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> – shows that we can only imagine the journalist’s shadow activities.</p>, <p>Of course the rabbit hole goes further than high-ranking civil servants; ‘The Unrepentant Marxist’, a communist blog presenting itself as an obscure underdog yet somehow racking up six million views, exploded with activity following the death.  The blog’s author Louis Proyect has dedicated an article to the Irishman’s activism, crediting his friendship with Noel Ignatiev and Kevin to his time in the neo-trotskyite movement, likening the trio to red ‘vanguard’ soldiers<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> (yes – <em>the department head of Harvard University, Ignatiev</em>).  It would be a claudicate task to have fabricated such articles, in short order, and following a death which most of his readership are still completely unaware of.  Likewise, there has been a simultaneous outpouring of data on other websites within the span of several days with their own regales of Kevin.  Could it be that these surface level outré blogs are merely a cover for a ring of neo-marxists?  Color me shocked.</p>, <p>It appears that before writing his 2019 hit-piece on Arktos media ‘Lost Imperium’, the self-avowed journalist had been racking up quite the portfolio of work.  Although <em>Dreamer of The Day </em>includes passing mention of Coogan’s work with journals such as <em>Mother Jones</em><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> (surprisingly, a co-author of perhaps their most infamous issue on white-nationalism, see ‘Europe’s New Fascists’),<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> it was not until a month ago that a complete list of his works was released.  Just as suspicious as the geocities websites and underground blogs one must navigate in order to make sense of this prolific author’s work, there is far more than initially meets the eye.  ‘Beyond The Fringe Politics’ lists 34 works that were either independently pursued or co-authored in his free time, most of which are anti-rightist and suggestively intelligence based.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>  Much how the UK magazine titled <em>Lobster</em>, which hosted Coogan’s work twenty years prior to his latest attack, is under a buried geocities style webpage described as a ‘journal of parapolitics, intelligence and state research’.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>, <p>So what are we to make of Coogan’s recently veiled attack (if we are to borrow a phrase of his)<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> on Bolton? It appears that just as much camouflage was employed in the Irishman’s personal life as in his faux objective reporting; <em>Dreamer of the Day</em> being popularized within the communities he investigated for the ADL and SPLC.  Irrespective to whether or not this was intentional, it would come as no surprise that such documentary and commercial hype was an asset for like organizations.  As we will come to expose, Coogan continued affiliation with multiple left-hand-path groups which he attempted to dissociate himself with for professional reasons – on the surface, ostensibly ‘journalism’, which was a cover for perhaps his own homebrewed espionage.  Without a doubt, he had made himself familiar with <em>Fascist Odyssey </em>and had been following Bolton and Arktos for years in the shadows.</p>, <p>In fact, it was about twenty years prior when he published his initial attack on the Kiwi; the final Appendix of Yockey’s initial biography titled, ‘Francis Parker Yockey and the Devil’, attempts to associate itself with pop-occult figures such as Varg Vikernes and Michael Moynihan,<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> in what appears to be a smoke screen for its greater vitriol toward Kerry Bolton.  Such attempts to sway the reader’s attention to Moynihan’s affiliation with the Church of Satan, tandem the near farcical threat of ‘Black Nazi Metal’ rock bands, are suspect; Coogan himself had maintained contact with many off-color groups during his work with the ADL, including the rings of satanism.  With his passing it is now widely available that the Irishman claimed to have been abused as a youth in the cult of Lyndon LaRouche, head of the NCLC (National Caucus of Labor Committees), of which The New York Times obituary attests Coogan’s membership of.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>  Proyect’s memorial of the biographer also claims that by happenstance he was an abuse victim of the cult as well, and that they managed to stumble upon one another via blog comments.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>, <p>An awfully convenient circumstance., given that Proyect claims his work of LaRouche was intended to be performed marxist qua marxist until Coogan contacted him anonymously to suggest otherwise.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>  Irrespective to his appearance as capable viz. an association with Noel Ignatiev, said testimony gives an appearance of the tail wagging the dog. According to Proyect, Coogan had pseudonymously nudged him with a hundred plus comments on his cult articles until revealing his true name – claiming that he had been using a handle to protect himself from LaRouche’s goons.  Begging the question as to why, if such a group was a reckoned power decades past, that the Irishman used his real name in 1999 only to change so in 2017?</p>, <p>Given that both men set out to publish joint works on LaRouche following their acquaintance, now claiming the cult leader should be rebranded as an ‘American fascist’, we can substantiate that ‘The Unrepentant Marxist’ is not simply a cut-out job to discredit Coogan.  Of course, The New York Times obituary asserts that the journalist was interested in far-left causes during his youth, and it appears that in circles outside of ‘The Unrepentant Marxist’ he maintained the alibi as being coaxed into abuse.  However, he admits on Proyect’s website that he infiltrated the LaRouche cult <em>intentionally</em> under the auspice of holding marxian views.  Stating, “I told them that I was in Columbia SDS in the sixties and used to go to his lectures – a total lie.  I also told them that I read ‘Dialectical Economics: An Introduction to Marxist Political Economy’, which was only a [an additional] white lie…”<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>  More than several articles compiling an analysis of the cult were under his pseudonymous authorship, and only revealed until after his death according to the trotskyite editor (now running cover for his online buddy).</p>, <p>Appearing on the surface as a kind of self-aggrandizing attempt to imitate the espionage of his fascist competitors, though, this brings a whole new light to the journalist’s life.  Following the distribution of Bolton’s work as a counter to the anti-fascist, a slew of critical insider reviews surfaced.  Two of those critical on <em>Dreamer</em> authored by self-proclaimed [unwitting] informants to Coogan (one now redacted).<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>  If it were not for the SPLC and ADL substantiating claims that the Irishman had cooperated with them, and a simultaneous leak of correspondence proving his connection with Adam Parfrey, I would have not included mention of the following (now redacted) Amazon review: it appears that one of the sources for his biography had accused the journalist of working with David Horowitz, the ADL, and plagiarizing much of Parfrey’s work on researching Yockey (which was allegedly compiled over a lengthy period of time by the anarcho-satanist crowd after Yockey’s death in 1960).</p>, <p>This would explain the immense citations by Coogan which have long been the source of twisted faces attempting to reason how one man could be so voluminous.  Many of which would have required travel to exotic countries, tracking down personal contacts of Yockey which are either impossible to find or dead.  As asserted in the article ‘Lost Imperium’, the journalist continues to credit himself as the originator.  Of course, his later mention of meeting Huxley-Blythe after the work was published<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> begs questions as to how he would pull off meeting a fascist after exposing himself as an ADL crony who manipulated Willis Carto and H. Keith Thompson’s inner circle, likewise, maintaining friendships with conflicting occult groups worldwide seen as international terrorists.  Something smells awry.</p>, <p>A light bulb went off in my head when reading the now redacted testimony – <em>Dreamer </em>mentions Adam Parfrey in passing, after attempting to affiliate him with the Church of Satan and fascist movements as a snide dismissal.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>  In anachronistic fashion, the work’s extensive name-dropping which limited the author from listing all discussed figures in its index just so happens to relegate a space for Parfrey.  Out of the hundreds of names which may have drawn attention, Coogan allows a modest corner in the glossary of his text.  It is interesting, then, that a significant portion of his breath was spent claiming throughout the biography that movements like American anarchy and satanism began archiving Yockey’s work<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> – at one point suggesting a connection between Keith Stimely and Feral House.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>  Of course, these anonymous parties were never given joint credit in researching the text.</p>, <p>Counter-Currents Publishing (which has come to the defense of Bolton’s works) hosted a memorial to Adam Parfrey following his death.  The vigil’s author <em>Margot</em> (same as the unwitting informant) asserts that Adam was, in fact, a satanist.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>  But my concern is more than throwing about quips on one’s risqué faith; we can now uncover a nexus between the anarcho-satanist publisher Feral House (Parfrey’s), Autonomedia (anarcho-marxist publisher of <em>Dreamer</em>), Coogan’s attempts to dissociate from the occult vis-à-vis LaRouche, and the many red-herrings of his text claiming a vanilla lifestyle.  Much how his surface level anti-bolshevism in <em>Dreamer</em> and ‘Lost Imperium’ are exposed as phony upon Proyect’s testimony, the same goes for his attempts to slash and burn affiliations with prior circles he investigated.</p>, <p>It appears that the pseudonymous informant of ‘Margot’ – whose review has not yet been redacted – is also behind the blog ‘Margot Metroland’ documenting Adam Parfrey’s life (mirrored by Counter-Currents).  Through ‘Remembering Adam Parfrey’, we finally get a written testimony mirrored on two sites by an author under the same handle, stating that Coogan was given the information to compile Yockey’s biography.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>  We can confidently assume this is the same figure: the East Coast flagship partner of Counter-Currents which Antifa went through many gyrations to find.  Meaning that, if the Celt had been surveilling her in the nineties, long before the journal’s existence, he was in deep.</p>, <p>The informant’s redacted testimony on Coogan also claims that he maintained contact with the Horowitz family.  Specifically David Horowitz, the Jewish radio show host who has waffled between pro and anti-Israeli conspiracy theories over the years in similar fashion to the froth drummed up by Turning Point USA.  Which is fascinating for that following the death of Adam Parfrey, an anarcho-satanist figure ‘<em>Mitch Horowitz</em>’, performed an interview celebrating the life of his satanist peer.  See, ‘Mitch Horowitz on the Power of Positive (and Satanic) Thinking’.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>  As we display in a later source, private emails between a head author of Feral House to Coogan prove that Dave Horowitz <em>had</em> taken a liking to the Celt.  In fact, Dave Emory appears to have spoken on radio shows within the same circle as Horowitz to puff up Coogan’s theory about red-Nazis.  Specifically a show going by the name ‘Something’s Happening’, in which Parfrey’s research was overlooked to discuss more derisory theories about the Bush family as Marxian red-fascists.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></p>, <p>As if center-politic did not already dismiss Jewish fealty as a contrived rouse!  Let me guess – the secret is they are actually alien-lizard fascists pretending to be Jews in order to run cover for ‘Q’?  Ah, that makes much more sense than financial elite!  In all seriousness, there is an eerie similarity between Emory’s Bush shenanigans and those of Coogan on LaRouche; in another ‘Unrepentant Marxist’ publication, ‘Lyndon LaRouche (1922-2019): a political assessment’, he attempts to implicate Roger Stone and Trump in the occult.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>  Although there may be a relation between <em>Occidental Dissent</em>’s recent expose on Stone’s ties to Weev (suspected quadruple-agent-double-0-Yid, Alan Auernheimer),<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a> this is a far cry from such parallelomania.  Even hosting a website, ‘LaRouche Planet’, where it is argued that the man was weaving layered false dilemma conspiracies about 9/11 as cover for the Saudi’s (the <em>legitimate</em> attackers he purports the Frenchman is aligned with).<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>  Is your head spinning yet?</p>, <p>We may also substantiate leaked emails documented on Wiki’s ‘Talk:Feral House’ and Mail-Archive, that there had been a dispute between Kevin and Adam.  The journalist now using a non-sequitur to accuse Feral House of being pro-Nazi for its satanic bent.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>  If anything, this appears to be a flailing attempt by Coogan to cut ties with a former asset.  Is he schizophrenic, manipulative, or a self-aggrandizing journalist?  At this point God only knows but we can infer that Uma Zykofsky’s (State Deputy Director) glowing words on his amicable nature overlook a much darker side.  By way of combing through the email chain of Feral House author Alex Constantine (attacked by a Coogan supporter and Wiki contributor looking to antagonize his defensive position), we see that Coogan and Parfrey had collaborated on other works in partnership:<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a> specifically, <em>Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism</em>, as well as <em>Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity</em>.  In <em>Black Sun</em>, Goodricke (who wrote the forward to Coogan’s <em>Dreamer</em>) cites Moynihan’s response to the Irishman’s inflammatory attacks.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>  It is tremendously important to note, then, that the sole message which Wikipedia chose to redact was the one they acknowledge as unequivocally noting Coogan’s thievery.  We have been able to retrieve the email transcript from Mail-Archive, signed ‘AC’ [Alex Constantine].  Constantine verbatim accuses Kevin Coogan of plagiarism in a ‘cc’ message to Dave Emory.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></p>, <p>Likewise, Emory, the journalist partially responsible for the promotion of <em>Dreamer</em> (implicated in the argument between Constantine and the anonymous Wiki author, Proyect’s documentation of obscure ties between Coogan and anarchist publications viz. Emory’s introducing him through additional puff-jobs in the Anarchist <em>Maximum Rock</em> magazine)<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a> leaves his condolences for The New York Times obituary among other international names.  “It was my privilege and pleasure to have interviewed Kevin on many occasions…”<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>  Again – could it be that many superficial activist and outré circles are merely cut-outs for intelligence research?  I rest my case.</p>, <p>His appendix is just as dismissive as his latter essay ‘Lost Imperium? Yockey: 20 Years Later’.  “A small trove of writings by Yockey recently surfaced halfway around the world… in a pamphlet entitled <em>Varange</em>… by Kerry Bolton, a New Zealand-based rightist and self-proclaimed Satanist.”<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>  Later writing that the Kiwi’s focus on James Madole – a mainstay whipping boy of Coogan’s biography – is deserving of condemnation.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a>  It may appear intentioned on the surface, but given the Irishman’s approach to besmirching a competing biography, often on the basis of its sheer presence interrupting his own limelight, such claims must be questioned.  Of course, given the leaked information on Coogan’s affiliation with Noel Ignatiev, and his choosing the self-titled ‘anarchist post-structuralist’ publishing house dawning a Marxist red star to distribute his work, methinks this ‘investigative journalist’ was more ideologue than literary servant.</p>, <p>Shortly before Kevin’s death, ‘Lost Imperium’ brought much more evidence to the fore of his suspect activities.  It seems that the major purpose of the article was to be a hit-piece, but why in <em>Lobster Magazine</em>?  One can only imagine that if it were his intention to bring such inflammatory disputes public, he would have performed such beyond the confines of a buried geocities website dedicated to ‘parapolitical intelligence research’.  Though, it is not my intention here to claim we wholly know the motives behind its chief editor, Robin Ramsay, who is the figure responsible for deeming the journal’s purpose as ‘state research’.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>  We can say, however, that there is a consistent thread to their interests; much of his earlier work has been on promoting the UK’s now far-left Labour Party, under the auspice of warning against their swing to extremism as a bad PR move.  See <em>The Rise of New Labour </em>and <em>Smear! Wilson and the Secret State</em>.<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>  It makes sense, then, that they would have endorsed <em>Dreamer of the Day</em>’s mission to paint the red-scare as an American-fascist operation (see the ‘red swastika’ on the cover, which is a chapter title within and also a favorite saying of the author).</p>, <p>Coogan’s main gripe, which <em>Lobster</em> endorses in Issue 78, is that Bolton disrupted his own monolithic presence as the sole biographer on Yockey.  See, “Bolton’s need to cast Yockey in the best possible light makes his <em>Yockey</em> needlessly dull at times… it is first worth noting that there are no breathtaking surprises in Bolton’s study for readers of <em>Dreamer.</em>”<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>  Often sinking to the level of trite quips to discredit the Kiwi – in response to his competitor retrieving further documentation on the fascist spy from Willis Carto he writes, “It is possible that Carto’s archive might hold a historical nugget or two.  However when I interviewed Carto – and in the two decades that followed <em>Dreamer</em> – he had every opportunity to contribute new revelations about Yockey but failed to do so.”<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a>  Further, “Large sections of <em>Yockey: A Fascist Odyssey</em> can even be read as a series of extended footnotes to my <em>Dreamer of the Day.</em>”<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a></p>, <p>The Irishman’s accusation of a failed competitor are reflective of his own inability.  If he truly were the man who compiled decades’ worth of research, would he not be content with Bolton’s surfacing of new data on Yockey?  This is downplayed in his analysis of the text; “Bolton also remains as mystified as I… Nor can Bolton make sense…”<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a>  Perhaps there still exist hard boiled mysteries to Yockey’s life.  As in the case of ‘Alexander Scharf’ – the ostensibly Jewish double-agent whose intentions for the lawyer are still unclear.  But Coogan’s remarks are unwarranted, so much as Bolton clarifies spots where his haphazardness falls short.  I.e., <em>Dreamer</em>’s claims that there was no way of substantiating where William Wernecke’s conflict with the Coyne family (tandem Alice Yockey) originated were recently clarified by the Ernie Lazar FBI files.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a>  Equally, Coogan’s attempts to substantiate claims of his subject being born of a different father (and a crypto Jew at that!)<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a> were refuted by Margot.<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a></p>, <p>Another strange coincidence worth noting is the attempt to associate Keith Stimely with Feral House.  By way of Alex Constantine’s private conversation, we can see that Coogan discredited his peer via Emory’s appearance on ‘Something’s Happening’.<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a>  Why would he do this?  <em>Dreamer</em> seems to emphasize the parallel researcher’s existence on the opposite coast of the country (perhaps as alibi),<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a> but alas, there is a catch.  Feral House was on the West Coast with Coogan during his biographical work, likewise, Autonomedia operates out of Brooklyn, and Coogan had claimed to have traveled all over Europe tracing down political war criminals in hiding.  So he was the true itinerant.</p>, <p>Their simultaneous discovery of watershed FBI files is portrayed simply as a miracle.  Of course, he dismisses any work the peer may have accomplished, “As far as I can determine, he [Keith] never wrote a single page of his proposed Yockey biography.”<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a>  One thing is for certain: speaking for the dead is far easier than the living.  Alex Constantine put up a fight for his publisher’s reputation given that his party was still breathing.  It appears that the attempt to play off any affiliation with Stimely was executed when Parfrey’s crew was hot on Coogan’s tail.  Given Stimely’s affiliation with Yockey’s closest friends, many of whom were the same international figures cited in <em>Dreamer</em>, and the off-handedness with which the Celt includes Thompson and sundry in the Feral House patois to avoid peer-credits, perhaps there was at least ‘a single page’.  If Coogan allegedly accessed the FBI files at the same time as Keith in the eighties, with Margot being surveilled in the mid-nineties, we find a much different picture than an ad hoc researcher whipping 700 pages out of thin air.</p>, <p>If anything, the manic flailing of this ‘journalist’ should not be interpreted as a series of disjunctive breakdowns.  Why the connection to California’s State Department, grooming of Proyect’s Trotskyite circle, clandestine research propping up Anarchist journals, friendships with Harvard department heads, ‘intelligence research’, and the astroturfing of mania around Nazi-Satanist shock-jock?  Narcissism driving authors into loose cannon profligacy is nothing new, but Coogan was no amateur.  His work remains well documented on the SPLC website,<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a> and his cooperation with the ADL and FBI on <em>Dreamer</em> is telling.  Even more so are his attempts to inveigle Bolton – one minute claiming that his competitor’s writing hosts a foul ‘stench’,<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a> the next attempting to flatter by way of supporting the religious theories of Yockey’s past, then claiming that Yockey’s legacy was tarnished by Bolton’s unnecessary affiliating of the spy with anti-Semitism.<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a>  These are merely slash and burn tactics; Coogan’s closing of ‘Lost Imperium’, claiming that Bolton is a Russian-Commie apologist while simultaneously propping up crypto-Marxist groups via Ignatiev, are perfectly mirrored to his circular accusations of LaRouche and Parfrey.</p>, <p>Irrespective to whether Coogan was mistreated by LaRouche, he infiltrated the organization by way of lying; Parfrey and Sundry appear to have been charmed by the man early on, only later to be discarded; ‘Margot’ attests to the fact that Coogan presented himself dishonestly when courting Yockey’s remaining contacts, only later to create a far-Left interpretation of the lawyer; Proyect found himself in cahoots with the alleged Bolshevist author, then later having his work directed into a patchwork theory wherein LaRouche was deemed a fascist; finally, the consummate work of the journalist’s latter years intended to follow up to <em>Dreamer</em> (a multi-volume tome on Marx) has been left in the hands of Proyect as the Irishman’s final wish to paint Marx as a quasi-fascist.<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a>  If I may paraphrase a man of greater poetic ability, the use of artifice inevitably leads to one’s downfall… “It almost always happens that he who uses it to cover one spot uncovers himself in another.”<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a></p>, <p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Uma Zykofsky et al., ‘Kevin J.

She is thus expressing anxiety…</p>, <p>When “Karen” asks to speak to your manager, she is really lashing out at the declining standards of decency, respect, and politeness in multicultural society. She is thus expressing anxiety over is her inability to escape from manifestations of liberalism in decline. “Karen moments” ought to be understood as microcosms of psychological White Flight. They represent the petty refusal of the White woman to accept the consequences of a bargain that she consciously made.</p>, <p>As racialists and Third Positionists, we understand that different races are, on aggregate, not adapted nor capable of adapting to living alongside each other and by each other’s cultural standards within a pluralist assimilation. Time and again, we demonstrate that such arrangements are not sustainable and lead to unhappiness and the degeneration of the entire society. A racialist is therefore <em>more</em>—not less—inclined towards true empathy and understanding when non-Whites fail to conform to the cultural standards of White society, just as a racialist understands why a White person may be incapable of conforming to the cultural standards of any non-White society. Consequently, somebody who has fully internalized their racialism is <em>less</em> likely to lash out or experience a “Karen moment” than somebody who has been deracinated and atomized by their own liberal ontology.</p>, <p>What is a Karen then? A Karen is just a female “racist liberal.”</p>, <p>The particular manifestation of liberalism in decline that the Karen takes offense at is the inability of the non-White to live up to what used to be the cultural norm of liberal society back when it was demographically White. The Karen chastises the non-White effectively for their being insufficiently liberal, and in doing so, exposes both her own latent racial anxieties as well as her unwavering loyalty towards the liberal system. In truth, however, it is the Karen herself who is failing to adapt to the ever-changing cultural standards of liberalism. It is the behavior of the non-White that represents the new cultural norm—ascendant, empowered and favored by the current liberal system, much to Karen’s detriment.</p>, <p>Just as the male racist liberal lashes out in desperation for liberal society to revert to its “1950s” iteration when the White man still reigned supreme, the lashing out of the Karen represents her desperation for liberal society to reverse a transformation that she has only just begun to feel. In other words, the emergence of the Karen meme represents liberal society having surpassed peak White woman. Having spent the last 120 years gradually empowering themselves at the expense of social cohesion, sacrificing their most sacred roles as mothers and wives in exchange for a chance to climb the social ladder alone and atomized, White women are now in a state of decline. Just as liberalism betrayed White men, it has now begun to betray White women, just as it will inevitably betray the non-White coalition that it will elevate next, and so on.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3147" height="295" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/karen-memes-10-300x295.png" width="300"/></p>, <p>White men have already been feeling liberalism’s cold shoulder for a long time, and so among many men, the Karen meme invokes sentiments of <em>Schadenfreude</em>— Karens everywhere are finally getting their just comeuppance! Not exactly an admirable or noble attitude towards our sisters, but understandable, especially given how eager White women were to twist the knife and express those same sentiments towards White men during our decline.</p>, <p>In the end, however, both White men and women made the same bargain with liberalism, trading our own atomization in exchange for material gains that were short-lived and ever fleeting from the get-go. We ought not to resent each other for this decision; however, we also ought not to play the victim, nor indulge each other’s delusions of victimhood. This was the future we chose. Every day of our lives, we made the conscious decision to remain atomized and deracinated and to buy into that system. Our inability to escape from these consequences is something that we must come to terms with, despite how terrifying it may be.</p>, <p>To a certain extent, we are all of us creatures of liberalism. Centuries of its dysgenic influence have changed us deeply. No amount of mollycoddling, wishful thinking, or even direct manipulation of demographics—something we collectively lack the power and will to do, anyway—is going to undo those changes. Only a revolution of our societal structure and institutions reflecting Third Position philosophy will allow us to begin the process of reversing the degeneracy of liberalism.</p>, <p>In strategizing over how to best ensure said revolution, I’ve seen many of my comrades discussing what ought to be our response to the Karen Question. To this I answer the following:</p>, <p>Should we sympathize with the Karens? Not exactly.</p>, <p>Should we reach out to the Karens? Yes, but not unconditionally.</p>, <p>As a movement, we must have standards, and we must enforce those standards universally, both inside our ranks and outside. The purpose of Third Position thinking has never been to cuddle people who remain fundamentally loyal towards liberalism. We are not here to provide people with a “safe space” to vent their racial anxieties and frustrations, while they continue to live their day-to-day lives within an ontologically liberal framework. We must constantly be <em>challenging</em> others to reject liberalism and <em>challenging</em> them to join us, if they dare, just as we must constantly be <em>challenging</em> ourselves to live and die by our own beliefs.</p>, <p>Over and over again, our impulse is to invite the “battered wives” of liberalism into our ranks, while turning a blind eye towards all the glaring signs and red flags that they remain hopeful that their abuser can be reformed and redeemed. We need to stop doing this. We must start thinking of our racial brethren as though they were drug-addicted junkies (their drug of choice: liberalism), and adjust our outreach tactics accordingly. Naturally, this applies to both men and women. We’ve had over four years to observe and reflect upon the consequences of the Alt-Right having “red-pilled” legions of cretinous racist liberals, who remain a burden on us to this day. We’ve still yet to learn from these mistakes.</p>, <p>Until they demonstrate commitment to Third Position beliefs, we should allow the system to attack these people with every weapon it has, to psychologically break them. Only then should we offer them our hand, so that we may then rebuild them by our own will, and if they still refuse our hand, then we have only to withdraw it and allow the system to attack further. The Karen meme itself is absolutely an invention of our enemies, it is absolutely anti-White, and it is used by our enemies to attack racist liberals. Good. Let them have at it. Let the racist liberals be broken again and again until they beg for our embrace.</p>, <p>We can have a certain sympathy for Karens and the dilemma they find themselves in . . . but they are not comrades, and they likely never will be. Indeed, they will likely never extract themselves from the spider’s web they’re caught in. They’ll probably never even want to.</p>, <p>We have become used to living under pax Americana that our analysis of almost all situations presupposes its continued existence, ironically even when such analysis calls for a new world…</p>, <p>We have become used to living under pax Americana that our analysis of almost all situations presupposes its continued existence, ironically even when such analysis calls for a new world order. Take as an example the proponents of ethnonationalism, in its most universalistic form, they demand that all peoples who aspire to a state of their own should be given one. Ethnonationalists argue this will prevent conflict by removing internal divisions over race and even ethnicity, to as large of a degree as possible. Furthermore, neighbouring countries will have fewer reasons to enter into conflicts, with their respective countrymen all being contained within a single state. We will have our little Flanders, little Scotland, and little Catalonia peacefully trading for their natural resources, following a global non-aggression principle. In their view there is no need for a united European state. These little statelets will form a defensive alliance that some ethnonationalists believe will be strong enough to prevent invasions from extra-European powers. But, anyone examining the historical record should find this ideology suspect. The entente powers split apart their opponents into relatively close approximations of ethnostates, compared to what came before. The fact that the greatest war in history came after this does not seem to bide well with the petty nationalist vision, perhaps real ethnonationalism has never been tried. They would reiterate that Germany started WW2 as a response to the dismemberment of their country, they would not be completely wrong. But, petty nationalists have no solution for the multiple other causes of conflict between states: to create defensible borders, to secure resources, secure captive export markets, build foreign military bases that can be used to project power, and in general to enlarge their spheres of influence. They handwave these aspects of foreign policy away, in the European context, with rather utopian sentiments of our common European brotherhood felt by today’s European nationalists, as if the feelings of people outside the halls of power will stay the same if they enter them. According to them trade will proceed as it does now, with or without the American empire; to say otherwise is to admit to chinks in their petty nationalist armour. Empire is unnecessary, “look today you can buy bananas in Moscow all the way from Central America”; what they forget is that the American post-WW2 system makes most of this unprotected global trade possible. The world that the petty nationalist desires, in fact, requires the existence of the American Empire.</p>, <p>Before we start discussing the faults with petty nationalism, it is important to discuss the unprecedented effect the American Empire has had on global trade. The importance of American naval supremacy cannot be overestimated. Prior to 1945 most trade was conducted within an imperial trading block or with immediate neighbours. As ocean going trade required a large navy to convoy ships to their ports of call, this was the primary role of the Royal Navy throughout most of its history. Since European powers might be involved in conflicts with each other, trade outside of your sphere of influence was quite risky since these imports would cease during war. Trading overseas was even more risky. The American system forced states within their Atlanticist sphere to decolonize, replacing the imperial trading block, where colonial powers extracted primary resources from colonies and used them as captive export markets, with the system of global and relatively free trade. Colonies once restricted to trading with their overlord now could trade with any nation and importantly, they were now open to American corporations.</p>, <p>There was a pax Britannica preceding the American order and global trade under this order grew to a degree, but this growth pales in comparison to the huge increases in trade post-1945. The growth of globalization has been a manifestation of the politics of the American order, rather than an emergent trend resulting from economics and technological progress. The United States created their order as a way of securing alliances against the threat of the Soviet Union. The huge American market was opened to their European and East Asian allies, allowing those states to trade their way back to prosperity. The United States cracked open the colonial world allowing both the victors and defeated powers of WW2 access to any natural resources they required, without military expansion or colonial holdings. The United States navy, virtually unchallenged globally, was committed to the freedom of the navigation, preventing any disruption of global sea trade. Subsequently, the price of shipping decreased drastically allowing supply chains that once were dispersed throughout a single country now to be dispersed throughout the world creating the global economy we have today.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3136">Pax Americana</p>, <p>After the fall of the USSR, the United States opened this global system to practically the entire world. This brought on the biggest artificial boom in history; states that have never been wealthy in their existence can now use trade to offset serious geographic weaknesses. This has allowed global populations in agriculturally poor states, such as those in Africa and the Middle East, to explode. China and to a lesser extent India have seen a massive growth in GDP. China has progressively climbed the value-added ladder, making their economy more and more advanced all in thanks to trade with the United States. But, the underlying reason the United States created this system was not to promote order and prosperity in the 3rd world but to contain and defeat the Soviet Union. American cold war policy sought to prevent the formation of a Eurasian hegemon, which would have controlled most of the world’s oil, resources, and population. The fall of the Soviet Union undermines the American order’s reason for its own existence and has become a serious conundrum to the global order, one that has been only exacerbated by President Trump. Namely this order was created primarily for political reasons not economic ones, the economic growth was only a by-product. The reality of the demise of the USSR has finally caught up with the United States, they are asking themselves the questions of why they should support trade deals designed to buy alliances. Deals that usually were at the expense of American industry for a war that is over, why should they underwrite the defence of the NATO? This trend of shirking away from their position as leaders of the global order is only being accelerated by the shale revolution, which has now made the United States a net exporter of oil. The United States has few economic incentives to continue the global order; those who argue the United States should pay for global stability seem to be losing the debate. In fact, the American economy is the least dependent on foreign trade amongst all the major powers; this is even more apparent when you consider the largest sources of American trade is to its neighbors: Mexico and Canada. Therefore, little by little, the American order will retreat to North America, and likely continue to support a few key partners such as Britain and Australia.</p>, <p>Eventually, some crisis will force a state’s hand to attack a rival’s shipping, perhaps to interdict oil shipments back home. If the United States doesn’t respond this will trigger a slow return to the old norm of naval power determining the reach of a countries merchant marine. As an aside, this could be triggered by an East-Asian tanker war over diminished gulf oil exports due to a direct Saudi Arabian-Iran military conflict disrupting production. The future order the petty nationalists require may cease to exist in the coming decade. The small states of Europe will find themselves in a very different world where your next shipment of oil is no longer guaranteed, and your exports could have no buyer. Let us then return to analyzing the claims of the petty nationalists in regard to the future of Europe.</p>, <p>The internal cohesion of Europe is waved aside as a non-issue since most of today’s nationalists are united by the common crisis that is affecting every European ethnicity. Is that the proper basis from which a European order can be created? <u>Greg Johnson</u> outlines the petty nationalist position on minimizing intra-European crisis:</p>, <p><em>As for white fratricide: the best way to defuse white ethnic conflicts is not to combat “petty” nationalism but to take it to its logical conclusion. If different ethnic groups yoked to the same system are growing restive, then they should be allowed to go their own ways. Through moving borders and moving peoples, homogeneous ethnostates can be created, in which each self-conscious people can speak its own language and practice its own customs free from outside interference. Such a process could be mediated by a European treaty organization, which could insure that the process is peaceful, orderly, humane, and as fair as possible to all parties. </em>(Johnson, 2015)</p>, <p>Geopolitical decisions in the petty-nationalist world are decided by morale principles rather than by cold calculations. They do not seem to consider the effects of these various decisions on the relative standing of the state in question to its competitors. Taking Quebec as a test case for these beliefs, under the petty nationalist world order Quebec would have long ago separated from the Canadian state. The Canadian state would surely be weakened by the loss of the vast natural resources of Quebec, its industrial base, and control over the St. Lawrence seaway which connects the Canadian core, Ontario, with the wider world. The fact that Quebec separatism was indulged on two separate occasions with a popular vote, and close ones at that, is indicative of the power of the American system. Losing such a large piece of territory would deprive that state of manpower, industry, resources, and provide an opportunity for rival powers to take this new state into their sphere of influence. This would only be compounded in the example of Quebec, where suddenly Canada would be cut off from its best ports in the East and from its most important trade route, the St. Lawrence. In the era preceding pax Americana, a successful separatist movement would have jeopardized the continued existence of a state by weakening its ability to defend itself. If Quebec were to have separated in the 19<sup>th</sup> or 20<sup>th</sup> century, Canada would likely have been absorbed by the United States. Today Canada could survive such an event because we are subjects of the American Empire. Today access to global resources markets and very likely the passage of goods through Quebec would be guaranteed, the United States not desiring economic chaos in its biggest trading partner. It is of no coincidence that separatism in states under the aegis of the American Empire is no longer considered a treasonous activity, unless that separatism is opposed to the American order of course. As well, it makes sense how in states outside of the American orbit, separatist regions and movements are not tolerated; examples can be seen in the Russian Federation and mainland China. The survival of these states as independent geopolitical entities means they do not have the luxury of supporting liberal moralism when it comes to the supposed right of self-determination.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3134">Quebec Separatist protest during the 1960 Quiet Revolution</p>, <p>The existence of global American power and the European Union gives the illusion that small European states can adequately function as independent entities. States with indefensible borders, tiny populations, little resources, and even without any access to the sea can thrive today. There is a common line of thinking that the horrors of the two world wars have made conflict between European nations unthinkable. But, this is not due to some fundamental pacifistic enlightenment spread after the destruction of WW1 and WW2, where we eschew violence and competition with our neighbours. It is because of the once bipolar and now unipolar nature of the current era, that we exist in an imperial paradigm. In his article “Grandiose Nationalism”, Greg Johnson lauds this as the vindication of ethnonationalism, as smaller states once subject to the Soviet Empire free themselves from tyranny:</p>, <p><em>Since the fall of the Soviet Empire, the tendency in Europe has been toward  ethnonationalism, either by the Czech and Slovak road of peaceful partition or Yugoslav road of war and ethnic cleansing. What is a more realistic path to peace: putting Yugoslavia back together, then Czechoslovakia back together, then unifying them both in a single state, with all the rest of Europe — or allowing peoples with long historical grudges to completely disentangle their affairs and lead their own lives? What is more likely to produce European amity: a shotgun wedding or an equitable divorce? </em>(Johnson, 2015)</p>, <p>But, these new states have not become truly independent entities. They quickly joined both NATO and the European Union for access to protection and the American global trading network. The use of military force as a means of furthering foreign policy aims has become unthinkable outside of Africa and the Middle East. To even consider that European states may enter into conflicts in the future, especially in the Northern European core, seems ludicrous. Geopolitical analysis is seen as something rather funny. It’s almost provincial to be concerned about the control of resources when any input the state needs can be purchased from almost anywhere on the planet. Not only can they be purchased, but they will arrive and arrive on time. Add to these conditions the overwhelming military superiority of America, where any aggressive action that destabilizes its order is dealt with punitively, and you can begin to see where our naive thinking on geopolitics comes from.</p>, <p>This is why Czechoslovakia can be split in two and it has little knock-on effects for the prosperity of the two nations as a whole. The Czech state need not be concerned with access to import and export markets, or even its own security. It does not even have to negotiate trade deals with its neighbours thanks to the European Union. The benefits of Slovak industry, manpower, and resources were useful to pre-war Czechoslovakia, but today the ability to defend your borders against aggressive neighbors is unnecessary. The emergent nation states that petty-nationalists laud are products of the very system they, generally speaking, oppose. If you take away this American pre-eminence and their control of the sea, which underwrites the existence of global trade, we land in a very different world. The Utopian thinking of the petty nationalist will be fundamentally challenged by the realities that states previously had to contend with in the pre-1945 world.</p>, <p>There is also a general pacifism in the views of the petty nationalists. This passage by Greg Johnson displays the naivete on the topic of foreign policy that is present in the petty-nationalist sphere:</p>, <p><em>The threat of non-white blocs should not be exaggerated. France, the UK, or Russia alone are militarily strong enough to prevail against anything that Africa, India, or the Muslim world can throw at us — provided, of course, that whites are again </em>morally <em>strong enough to take their own side in a fight. A simple alliance of European states would be able to deter any Chinese aggression. Thus a defensive alliance between European states would be sufficient to preserve Europe from all outside forces, whether they be armed powers or stateless masses of refugees and immigrants. </em>(Johnson, 2015)</p>, <p>What is most interesting about this passage is what is missing; everything is about deterrence and defensive alliances, but what about the projection of power? This is where the uni-polar world of the American Empire rubs off on us the most. It is here that there remains a large degree of liberalism in the dissident right. Europe needs only to defends its own borders; it does not to contend for the domination of Eurasia. But, that leaves Europe in a very tight spot. Europe is practically at the mercy of Russia to supply almost all of its oil and natural gas. If Europe is to be united together even in a simple defensive alliance this fact becomes very problematic. In a world where the United States has evacuated from Europe, Russia can use its near monopoly over much of Europe’s supply of oil to bring nations along its border back into its orbit. Europe as a loose alliance would practically be defenseless since its enemy controls such an important commodity, like Damocles sword handing over Europe’s head. If the tiny states of the petty-nationalist dream are to remain sovereign, they will have to at least form some alliance for the mutual extraction of resources, most importantly oil. This means they must project power into the Middle-East, North Africa, and/or West Africa to gain control over the distribution of oil, as well as protecting the convoy routes bringing it back to Europe. That fundamentally means engaging with China, Russia, Turkey, Iran, etc in a great power conflict. That brings us back to the flaws in petty-nationalist thinking, how can this assortment of sovereign states with uncoordinated militaries project power to compete with these powerful rivals?</p>, <p>The economies of scale required to maintain an adequate defense has been continuously increasing throughout history. Take for example the Dutch republic, which successfully defended itself against the much more powerful states of Spain and neighboring France throughout its early years. Denmark resisted various German states attempts at expansion northwards for centuries. Compare the success of these states in defending themselves a few centuries later against the Wehrmacht. What were once defensible and relatively powerful states were now defeated in a matter of days. As warfare has industrialized, larger industrial bases are required for the production of more advanced weaponry. The R&amp;D can be spread across different states, think the Eurofighter, as we see in Europe; but still small states cannot adequately adopt the full range of technologies required for a fully functional offensive military. This goes out the window if cooperation amongst European states were to break down. Designing cutting edge military hardware has become so very expensive, especially in terms of new aircraft, the per unit cost would be unaffordable for most states if the research was done alone. To utilize the full strength of combined arms in the 21<sup>st</sup> century requires a nation on the scale of the United States, Russia, or China. The cost of employing progressively more advanced weaponry prohibits small states from having capable defensive and especially offensive forces precluding substantial support from outside sources.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3139">Military band of the Chinese people’s Liberation Army in Jiujiang.</p>, <p>A European military would be able to project power outside of Europe, securing valuable resources the continent does not have. In a world with America as an absent superpower, the ability to trade globally will be determined by the strength of one’s navy and their ability to defend crucial seagoing trade routes. Major European powers such as England, France, and Germany could, after rearmament, still be able take control of West African oil reserves; but to compete with China or Russia, especially in the Middle East, will be far easier with most of Europe, especially the north, united. Furthermore, united they would be able to control far more resources and to regain control over lost territories. The vacuum created by America could allow the Chinese, Russians, or some other power to gain control over a large percentage of the Eurasian oil and strategic resources. This would force Europe to enter into a subservient relationship even without a military defeat, threatening the future prosperity of the continent. Or in another scenario where oil output dramatically decreases as various actors within the Middle East and Asia engage in conflicts prevented by American largess; for example, an Iran-Saudi war over Iraq or the Saudi Oil fields themselves.</p>, <p>Petty-nationalists claim that uniting much of Europe into a single state will create the intra-European conflicts that unity was meant to prevent. Deeply rooted ethnic animosities would bring this pan-European state down in its infancy. But, as of 2020 constant predictions about the imminent collapse of the European Union have not precipitated. The European Union remains a broadly popular institution across the continent. The European Union has moved to increase its power progressively over time without much resistance. At least in the present order, if the EU moved to centralize powers much further, I cannot foresee any conflicts arising from this, as long as France and Germany were cooperating. Like all states touched by the destructive effects of liberalism, the European Union has very major flaws; but these are matched and superseded by most of the member state’s national governments such as the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. The talking point describing the EU as the key instrument of some Kalergi plan is ludicrous as foreign immigration has clearly been spearheaded by the member states. As was mentioned previously, a Europe of sovereign states will be likely be dependent on foreign powers for its resources. Europe could be a location of proxy battles between extra-European great powers as they compete with each other for control of the Eurasian world island. A united Europe would be far less susceptible to interference by foreign states peeling off European nations into their spheres of influence.</p>, <p>Surely there will be conflict within a pan-European system and there will be a core population(s) which dominates the state. But, there has never existed these free and “sovereign” nations of petty nationalist dreams. Strong nations whether or not they are within a political union will come to exert large degrees of control over their weaker neighbours. In the case of pan-Europeanism, this relationship has been formalized allowing the greater integration of European militaries and economies into a global power more capable of projecting power. Poorer nations to the east and South will obviously have less of influence in the direction of such an empire compared to the wealthier Northern European states, but since the beginning of the industrial era this has clearly been the norm. The choice is not over a Europe of sovereign nation states proudly independent, but still respectful of each other, or Empire. It is between larger European nations, as they have always done, dominating the weaker states or an Empire that formalize this conflict inside its imperial system. Obviously, such a state will not be unitary but will be federal in nature; this could actually allow the partial autonomy of smaller nations like Catalonia that the petty- nationalists desire. The economy, military, science, and foreign policy would be controlled at the European wide level.</p>, <p>In fact, the European Union as an institution could be the fertile ground where Europe reforms itself as American power recedes. In this post-American scenario, no one state can partially monopolize the use of force to further its foreign policy objectives. In this world, the scope of useful state policies will decrease dramatically. The liberal dogmas concerning immigration and race will become impediments to national cohesiveness. The feminized society is not a society conducive to struggle. The attack on every western states core population will necessarily be stopped. The end of the prosperity and peace of the American era would likely act like Darwinism in the realm of politics. Due to the selection factors of the American order, states could follow liberalism to its ultimate logical conclusion. Prior to this order, decadent nations could not persist without reforming or falling to more virile external forces. The destructive effects of liberalism while still acting were at least held back by the necessity of national defense, that all changed in 1945 and radically accelerated after the breakup of the Soviet Union.</p>, <p>This Darwinism at the level of the state can be clearly viewed by comparing the early years of the Soviet Union with the Stalinist era. The Soviet Union attempted radical anti-hierarchical and feminist experiments during its inception. Many of the progressive policies of the Soviet Union were subsequently put on hold and reversed as the Soviet Union was threatened by outside powers, especially at the start of WW2. Stalin eliminated abortion as a means of increasing population growth during the great patriotic war. Many ideological leftist dogmas that threatened the state’s ability to make war were thrown aside while many of those previously associated with reaction were brought back. Russian nationalism and a subservient church were far more useful for the expansion and war making ability of the Soviet State than internationalism and radical experiments in family organization. This occurred out of necessity, either a state reforms and abandons degenerative policies or eventually it would be defeated by its rivals.</p>, <p>There is likely not much we can do prior to the challenging of American power by some exterior force. When that day comes the political sphere will open as some elites will search for useful ideas as to how to strengthen the ailing American state. We must be there with a coherent set of ideas that will be useful for the searching elite in the coming post-liberal era. The same will occur in Europe; there are already some stirrings in the water from President Macron about the need for a European army in a post NATO future. Macron has signaled a slight change in tack on the immigration question, perhaps it is a cynical ploy to steal attention from National Rally. Or it could be the beginnings of a European reorientation responding to the absenteeism of the American superpower. If our ideas are correct, the stop-gap benefit of mass immigration which is aimed at combating the very real problem of our aging demographics will quickly become a liability for various states survival in a more chaotic world. A distinctly possible scenario where the EU fractures as a response to the withdrawal of American support, and likely Russian interference, would lead to a far worse conflict than tensions between different constituent EU member states, which are constrained within the bureaucratic framework of the EU. Europe’s declining population is already requiring extra-European export markets for a growing percentage of industrial and luxury goods. Without the ability to sell these items abroad at competitive rates; Europe faces severe economic problems as a norm, especially combined with the ever-growing public spending associated with an aging population. This could lead more powerful states within the EU, out of economic necessity, to force neighbors into subservient relationships to create some market for their goods, acquire natural resources, and to use military technology created with the excess production. A state encompassing most of the Europe could apply these energies outside of Europe, particularly towards securing oil reserves and export markets in the Middle East and West Africa as well as containing an aggressive Russia, moving west in search of more defensible borders.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3133">Ernst Junger, 1920</p>, <p>Now that we have questioned whether the world desired by universalist ethnonationalists is possible, let us ask the question, is it even desirable? If you could supply all of Europe with the resources it needs to function, ensure its defense, and prevent conflict: would it be good to carve Europe into many independent states? If your only goal was the survival of individual European ethnic groups and some sort of traditionalist cultural rejuvenation, then this position would be sufficient. Given the history of the European civilization, this does not seem to be a sufficiently lofty goal for the Faustian man. To be cocooned in our respective countries untroubled by the outer world but also not exerting our will to power upon it, is an unsatisfying future. The true universalistic ethnonationalist position resembles only a slightly altered version of Francis Fukuyama’s own prediction. A world of ethnostates, stable due to homogeneity, frozen in place due to a lack of conflict. If you followed the logic of the proponents of ethnonationalism you would find history over, completed. It is easy to choose interesting times over stability from the comfort of your own home. But, who on the right can look through history and wish there will be no more empires to rival Rome, no grand conquests, no new mythic battles like Trafalgar and Agincourt? To make sure the surely unpleasant and violent, but oftentimes heroic, side of human nature stays in the history books. We would create no men in our own times to rival Ernst Junger, a true aristocratic of the soul. We would be left with a civilization stuck in the Spenglerian “culture” phase; either reproducing the same styles of art, architecture, and music that has come before or following the rabbit hole of deconstructionism further into the abyss. Perhaps the advanced technics of such a civilization could stop external enemies from defeating it, even for centuries. Such nations would be like enclaves depicted in the film <em>Zardoz</em>, highly civilized but ultimately stagnant.</p>, <p>That is why we must support Empire over our continued obsessions with little nation states. Even if these states could survive and even thrive after the decline of the American Empire, it would only lead to our own spiritual deaths. Faustian man needs to finally embrace the Spenglerian “civilization” phase of our existence. To unite the different European peoples under one flag, giving us the power to step away from the precipice we are inching towards. Then to spread our flag to the different corners of the globe, to create an Empire worthy of those that came before. We must think on a grand scale, first to ensure our premier place on this planet, to protect its environmental viability, and to provide enough resources so we can look towards the stars. It might never be possible to economically mine distant asteroids or to create self-sufficient colonies on Mars. But, this to me seems like a much more inspiring future than to aspire to a return to the small states and the small scale thinking of a bygone era. We should strive for a future where the full range of human existence is possible, both comfort and security but also the self-actualization through combat, which Junger and others have described. Perhaps the dream of a united Europe is also not possible without American military support; that the European nations will fall into conflict as the demographic replacement leads to our civilizational eclipse. But, let us aim for a future that is grander and far more interesting with new cultures, new empires, and new horizons than mere existence, as prescribed by the petty nationalists.</p>, <p>Type on the field below and hit Enter/Return to search</p>][]
