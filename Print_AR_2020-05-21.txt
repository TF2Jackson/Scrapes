We like imagine political struggles lens recent history Especially conservatives certain nostalgia Cold Warhard men hornrimmed glasses facing Commies across Iron Curtain global battle fate humanity But facing different kind enemy As probably sense college fault lines seem race culture economic production This struggle also ideological think terms  capitalism vs. socialism  misunderstand entirely.

Today leftists conveniently forget income inequality cheap labor union busting one issues conflicts cause bringing Third World immigration. At heart call Left three interconnected ideals equality universalism diversity Such terms often equivalent totems charms They magic words convey meaning importance without fixed definitions referents They gain power ambiguity. In mathematics equality statement two entities Politically speaking come mean every person political communityor fullblown  globalist  variation every human Earthshould rights opportunity outcomes legal political expressions In existential sense equality means words code Adolf Bastian code  psychic unity mankind.  In words  All Men Are Created Equal.  Universalism  origins theologicalthe idea humans worthy achieving salvation In modern times means political social norms matter circumstances On visceral level universalism idea somehow immoral prefer one  family culture nation others And let us honest struggles individuals communities nations almost never results equal outcomes often zerosumgamesthat winners losers. Diversity notion multiplicity different peoples flourishing together And opposed equality universalism diversity difference Indeed difference celebrated least differences human resource group hire universities corporations defines  diversity inclusive practice includes gender religious race age disability linguistic differences socioeconomic status cultural background.  list could go  doubt coming years will. ideal Diversity makes various demands  inclusion   safe spaces  likewhere one identity group least White identity group holds sway According  Inclusive practice known attitudes approaches strategies taken make sure students excluded learning environment differences.  Of course know diversity really means hear it  White   you.  These core ideals Leftsadly effectively socalled Right rarely questions Left philosophical level These ideals buried deep political discourse activism rarely scrutinize But scrutiny really take seriously  Are compatible human nature  Everyone equal People differentand differ individually groups  Diversity  least gets part right Diversity newest member trinity perhaps trickiest contradicts two When environmentalist says wants maintain  biological diversity  expressly trying make everything ecosystem would attempt treat ecosystem like Diversity way postcivil rights postmass immigration postempire postcolonialismeven postAmerican In words specifically comes global recognition nonWhite cultures It implies way incompatibility incommensurability two things  judged standard In words diversity implicitly recognizes identity least identities We seem never get seat table. On gut level call progressivism today really organized resentment There  crazed desire tear every remnant European past traditional American identity And manifests primal hatred people created WestWhite people Loyalty abstract idea  humanity  seems always manifest hostility one  people. Where come  late Andrew Breitbart popularized term  Cultural Marxism.  Cultural Marxism emerged due failed predictions orthodox Marxism namely  Revolution  would come industrialized world It also came increasing dissatisfaction Soviet Union For first decades Bolshevik Revolution Western Left defended apologized socialist experiment Eastern Europe Even voice establishment New York Times ran stories  Uncle Joe   new progressive Russia height mass purges. fn ffn It Soviet Union ironically became less Marxistwhen became closer military even fascist dictatorship social revolutionary forcethat Western Left turned erstwhile idol It revealing stern Communists see staring Soviet posters look closer rightwing propaganda SJW  churn today. Marxism originally based idea worldwide worker  revolution desirable historically inevitable Due impoverishment growth class consciousness workers industrialized parts worldsuch New York Paris Londonwould increasingly identify members class They would seize means production inaugurate new social order When World War began many socialists thought hour arrived This catastrophe would begin new world. Instead nationalism endured Workers identified countries class A Communist Revolution take place country relatively  behind  economically one industrial hothouses This led many theorists look explanation One influential writers tried explain twists turns Communism Antonio Gramsci He developed theory  cultural hegemony.  At heart idea society  beliefs values often implicit unconscious important part social order economic production political structures Cultural norms  traditional values  might call themgive society sense legitimacy order hierarchy Put Marxist terminology ideology maintains ruling class. Others went Pat Buchanan famously identified  Frankfurt School  aka Critical Theory a group interwar Marxist scholars Germanyas providing much intellectual heft radical social changes swept Western societies since s It  relatively obscure philosophers came program progressives adhere Nor kind conspiracy Critical theory Cultural Marxism ways everything regarded political transforming whole human conduct battlefield This normal intelligent people enter college vague belief  equality  within years posting Tumblr accounts oppressed separate restrooms men women idea  social construct  also familiar Traditions like family norms good evil distinctions man woman treated  propaganda  lies deconstructed. iframe allowfullscreen allowfullscreen memeembed frameborder  height  me.meembedi style maxwidth  margin auto width  iframe via me.me MEME But goes beyond Critical Theory subsequent offshoots including Critical Race Theory various  waves  Feminism Queer Studies rest simply tactics They ultimately comes something primal hatred excellence accomplishment power beauty If ultimate value Left egalitarianism ultimate enemy hierarchy White world global capitalism held oppressive We hated  freedom  civilization seen kind insult rest world horrible oppressive burden Whites want free it. Many nonWhites hate us perceived benefiting legacy oppression inheriting  privilege.  It  worth remembering West always pinnacle cultural development indeed point times history Europe relative backwater Parts Europe especially East suffered tyranny Ottoman Turks Barbary Pirates taking Europeans slaves well birth United States. But Age Exploration onwards largely White civilization essentially ruled worldpolitically economically also terms setting norms standards tastes As John Derbyshire put article explaining called  hesperophobia  hatred West They hate us humiliated showed gross inferiority culture To detested feared way barely understand Things got really bad th century When European society achieved industrial liftoff Europeans suddenly buzzing world like swarm bees They encountered cultures vegetating quiet conviction superiority centuries case Chinese millennia When encounters occurred encountered culture collapsed cloud dust strong fn ffn strong They hate us wounded ethnic pride They hate us cultural superiority say one remove political superiority actual arguments used justify resentment surprisingly weak supposed moral burden resulting civilizational success unique Whites. No one offended memory military adventurers Genghis Khan Tamerlane matter Islamic prophet Muhammed We would laugh reports Arabs demanding reparations Mongolia Greece calling reparations Turkey However expected take seriously Indian demands reparations Great Britain. Slavery colonialism universals history least largely ended West Yet today used rationale justifying collective punishment Western societies even nations peoples never slaves empires More point Western empires historical standards relatively benign even helpful. But though must recognize weak excuse Which brings us important reason Whites hated group evenor perhaps especially by Whites Whites believe mistreatment downplayed relatively  less bad.  Instead many Whites hold West unique role setting We want civilization dedicated human rights universal moral aspirations We therefore willing forego civilizational racial identity kind penance abolishing create greater good. Many nonWhites course happy go along acquiring revenge past civilizational defeats reaping rewards present job preferences set asides academia government redistribution wealth cultural recognition. And  sound bad  It seems like reasonable compromise This probably ultimately believe albeit want keep  limited government  free market capitalism institutions West going giving nonWhites moderate handouts kind consolation prize. But  going work  And importantly kind thinking makes impossible build kind free even functioning society Multiculturalism White guilt create motivation every nonWhite inside outside West come new tales victimization demands inclusion. Conservatives often say race  matter long people  assimilate.  But real question assimilate  Why anyone assimilate culture defined oppression  More importantly receive rewards assimilating default culture would crazy assimilate It would rational selfinterest assimilate. As  probably noticed nonWhite person accomplishes something terms scholarship career success often accused  acting White.  They told need express solidarity ethnic  community  lest guilty kind treason And see nonWhites ethnic  authenticity  usually expressed acts hostility Whites mainstream American society culture. We familiar millionaire Black celebrities lecturing working class Whites oppressed We see nonWhites sons daughters immigrants acting hatred hostility towards adopted country rather gratitude And many millions people may live country even achieved standard living undreamed forebears still regard groaning tyrannical White oppression. We  forget Colin Kaepernick made waves kneeling national anthem NFL preseason games halfWhite raised middleclass loving  privileged  adoptive White household He last found Black  authenticity  renouncing White America. When see nonWhites achieving American Dream makes happy think  sign country coming together That view nonWhite fellow citizens But succeed view quite differently They see success kind triumph even though cheering success. Thus Blacks tell  takes nation millions hold us back  Latinos talk growing strength  La Raza  even though  never wanted anything success groups Americans regardless color. Today assimilation least nonWhites impossibility Even nonWhites achieve economic  success  level impossible homelands guarantee identify Western culture institutions Indeed usually guarantee rebel seek alleviate guilt  inauthentic  acts cultural rebellion White civilization And thanks official multiculturalism economic motivations actively resist assimilation. Consider Black Studies professor Chicana Studies whatever  Studies  fashion month Does likely seem proud American despite good job billions people around world would consider practically utopian existence  We  also created kind motivation Whites essentially deassimilate culture If White civilization defined long history oppression would EuropeanAmerican proud heritage  Not surprisingly get increasingly comical attempts selfdelusion spiritually dispossessed Whites look new identity. We even see hilarious White people claiming nonWhite For Rachel Dolezal White girl accomplishments career prospects But tanned skin changed hair started calling AfricanAmerican She even claimed victim White supremacist groups harassing Suddenly able secure lucrative positions nonprofits universities At time history think people renouncing supposedly  privileged  position secure membership  oppressed  group  If think carefully singlehandedly disproved Critical Race Theory. But blame anyone else  clear economic incentive structure place You White person told ancestors basically scum You taught creation United States European settlers evil every White person existed civil rights movement essentially genocidal lunatic kind racial Original Sin White person internalized racism prejudice unconsciously. Why  people want throw burden guilt  For matter  specifically want throw cursed ancestry  And fact get economic social career benefits pull transition  hurt. What end nation actively despises accomplishmentunless couched victory Western society If nonWhite person something victory racist Whites trying prevent If White person something exercise privilege possible exceptions women homosexuals subminority group. It makes even less sense oldschool communism At least communism theory capitalists holding back production greed incentive exploit labor Communism enters inaugurate fair also technologically advanced system This generates new breed person less grasping healthier productive It  work way never least see people infatuated dream. Under Critical Theoryespecially comes race gendersuccess even possible In Cultural Marxism  oppressed   oppressor  new varieties categories created time goalposts constantly shifting And traditional Western society characterized  oppression  solution constantly promote forms identity break  deconstruct  society. overcoming past never ends There point  equal  everyone start acting normal We simply fight forever And Whites end repentance  Whiteness  Original Sin And unlike Christianity  antiracism  creed church offers salvation. Admit  seen happen Gay groups get criticized heavily White New  phobias  pathologies created seemingly every week Normal behavior love country desire family children pathologized sick oppressive And whereas years ago definition antiracist treating people equally regardless race talking race constantly definition racism. What kind culture created people behaving way  Well typical college know happens Think classes real knowledge least liberal arts downplayed favor endless hunt new forms  oppression.  Think aesthetics radical leftist students actively promote ugliness degeneracy break  social constructs.  Think accomplishments past expressed statues buildings must torn renamed honor  activists  whose accomplishment demand others could build themselves. For us life accomplishment Through power dedication create meaning building something goes beyond But modern Left life tearing everything surrounds And done time insist upon benefits standard living created civilization people despise could never hope equal. When come right modern leftwing college student enjoys subsidized existence decadent anything enjoyed member tsar  court This especially nonWhite students receive set asides government academia And yet LARP grizzled revolutionaries war everything around even key institutions government take side defend them. Under Cultural Marxism  way Americans colors unite people nation Instead modern college war And American society increasingly resembles one giant college endless conflict cease. outcome predictable EuropeanAmericans continue dispossessed despised demoralized eventually destroyed Whatever ideas abstractions institutions value going destroyed You may aware White person matter Your values survive dispossession Look happening college test truth words.

At heart call Left three interconnected ideals equality universalism diversity Such terms often equivalent totems charms They magic words convey meaning importance without fixed definitions referents They gain power ambiguity. In mathematics equality statement two entities Politically speaking come mean every person political communityor fullblown  globalist  variation every human Earthshould rights opportunity outcomes legal political expressions In existential sense equality means words code Adolf Bastian code  psychic unity mankind.  In words  All Men Are Created Equal.  Universalism  origins theologicalthe idea humans worthy achieving salvation In modern times means political social norms matter circumstances On visceral level universalism idea somehow immoral prefer one  family culture nation others And let us honest struggles individuals communities nations almost never results equal outcomes often zerosumgamesthat winners losers.

On gut level call progressivism today really organized resentment There  crazed desire tear every remnant European past traditional American identity And manifests primal hatred people created WestWhite people Loyalty abstract idea  humanity  seems always manifest hostility one  people. Where come  late Andrew Breitbart popularized term  Cultural Marxism.  Cultural Marxism emerged due failed predictions orthodox Marxism namely  Revolution  would come industrialized world It also came increasing dissatisfaction Soviet Union For first decades Bolshevik Revolution Western Left defended apologized socialist experiment Eastern Europe Even voice establishment New York Times ran stories  Uncle Joe   new progressive Russia height mass purges. fn ffn It Soviet Union ironically became less Marxistwhen became closer military even fascist dictatorship social revolutionary forcethat Western Left turned erstwhile idol It revealing stern Communists see staring Soviet posters look closer rightwing propaganda SJW  churn today. Marxism originally based idea worldwide worker  revolution desirable historically inevitable Due impoverishment growth class consciousness workers industrialized parts worldsuch New York Paris Londonwould increasingly identify members class They would seize means production inaugurate new social order When World War began many socialists thought hour arrived This catastrophe would begin new world. Instead nationalism endured Workers identified countries class A Communist Revolution take place country relatively  behind  economically one industrial hothouses This led many theorists look explanation One influential writers tried explain twists turns Communism Antonio Gramsci He developed theory  cultural hegemony.  At heart idea society  beliefs values often implicit unconscious important part social order economic production political structures Cultural norms  traditional values  might call themgive society sense legitimacy order hierarchy Put Marxist terminology ideology maintains ruling class. Others went Pat Buchanan famously identified  Frankfurt School  aka Critical Theory a group interwar Marxist scholars Germanyas providing much intellectual heft radical social changes swept Western societies since s It  relatively obscure philosophers came program progressives adhere Nor kind conspiracy Critical theory Cultural Marxism ways everything regarded political transforming whole human conduct battlefield This normal intelligent people enter college vague belief  equality  within years posting Tumblr accounts oppressed separate restrooms men women idea  social construct  also familiar Traditions like family norms good evil distinctions man woman treated  propaganda  lies deconstructed. iframe allowfullscreen allowfullscreen memeembed frameborder  height  me.meembedi style maxwidth  margin auto width  iframe via me.me MEME But goes beyond Critical Theory subsequent offshoots including Critical Race Theory various  waves  Feminism Queer Studies rest simply tactics They ultimately comes something primal hatred excellence accomplishment power beauty If ultimate value Left egalitarianism ultimate enemy hierarchy White world global capitalism held oppressive We hated  freedom  civilization seen kind insult rest world horrible oppressive burden Whites want free it. Many nonWhites hate us perceived benefiting legacy oppression inheriting  privilege.  It  worth remembering West always pinnacle cultural development indeed point times history Europe relative backwater Parts Europe especially East suffered tyranny Ottoman Turks Barbary Pirates taking Europeans slaves well birth United States. But Age Exploration onwards largely White civilization essentially ruled worldpolitically economically also terms setting norms standards tastes As John Derbyshire put article explaining called  hesperophobia  hatred West They hate us humiliated showed gross inferiority culture To detested feared way barely understand Things got really bad th century When European society achieved industrial liftoff Europeans suddenly buzzing world like swarm bees They encountered cultures vegetating quiet conviction superiority centuries case Chinese millennia When encounters occurred encountered culture collapsed cloud dust strong fn ffn strong They hate us wounded ethnic pride They hate us cultural superiority say one remove political superiority actual arguments used justify resentment surprisingly weak supposed moral burden resulting civilizational success unique Whites. No one offended memory military adventurers Genghis Khan Tamerlane matter Islamic prophet Muhammed We would laugh reports Arabs demanding reparations Mongolia Greece calling reparations Turkey However expected take seriously Indian demands reparations Great Britain. Slavery colonialism universals history least largely ended West Yet today used rationale justifying collective punishment Western societies even nations peoples never slaves empires More point Western empires historical standards relatively benign even helpful. But though must recognize weak excuse Which brings us important reason Whites hated group evenor perhaps especially by Whites Whites believe mistreatment downplayed relatively  less bad.  Instead many Whites hold West unique role setting We want civilization dedicated human rights universal moral aspirations We therefore willing forego civilizational racial identity kind penance abolishing create greater good. Many nonWhites course happy go along acquiring revenge past civilizational defeats reaping rewards present job preferences set asides academia government redistribution wealth cultural recognition. And  sound bad  It seems like reasonable compromise This probably ultimately believe albeit want keep  limited government  free market capitalism institutions West going giving nonWhites moderate handouts kind consolation prize. But  going work  And importantly kind thinking makes impossible build kind free even functioning society Multiculturalism White guilt create motivation every nonWhite inside outside West come new tales victimization demands inclusion. Conservatives often say race  matter long people  assimilate.  But real question assimilate  Why anyone assimilate culture defined oppression  More importantly receive rewards assimilating default culture would crazy assimilate It would rational selfinterest assimilate. As  probably noticed nonWhite person accomplishes something terms scholarship career success often accused  acting White.  They told need express solidarity ethnic  community  lest guilty kind treason And see nonWhites ethnic  authenticity  usually expressed acts hostility Whites mainstream American society culture. We familiar millionaire Black celebrities lecturing working class Whites oppressed We see nonWhites sons daughters immigrants acting hatred hostility towards adopted country rather gratitude And many millions people may live country even achieved standard living undreamed forebears still regard groaning tyrannical White oppression. We  forget Colin Kaepernick made waves kneeling national anthem NFL preseason games halfWhite raised middleclass loving  privileged  adoptive White household He last found Black  authenticity  renouncing White America. When see nonWhites achieving American Dream makes happy think  sign country coming together That view nonWhite fellow citizens But succeed view quite differently They see success kind triumph even though cheering success. Thus Blacks tell  takes nation millions hold us back  Latinos talk growing strength  La Raza  even though  never wanted anything success groups Americans regardless color. Today assimilation least nonWhites impossibility Even nonWhites achieve economic  success  level impossible homelands guarantee identify Western culture institutions Indeed usually guarantee rebel seek alleviate guilt  inauthentic  acts cultural rebellion White civilization And thanks official multiculturalism economic motivations actively resist assimilation. Consider Black Studies professor Chicana Studies whatever  Studies  fashion month Does likely seem proud American despite good job billions people around world would consider practically utopian existence  We  also created kind motivation Whites essentially deassimilate culture If White civilization defined long history oppression would EuropeanAmerican proud heritage  Not surprisingly get increasingly comical attempts selfdelusion spiritually dispossessed Whites look new identity. We even see hilarious White people claiming nonWhite For Rachel Dolezal White girl accomplishments career prospects But tanned skin changed hair started calling AfricanAmerican She even claimed victim White supremacist groups harassing Suddenly able secure lucrative positions nonprofits universities At time history think people renouncing supposedly  privileged  position secure membership  oppressed  group  If think carefully singlehandedly disproved Critical Race Theory. But blame anyone else  clear economic incentive structure place You White person told ancestors basically scum You taught creation United States European settlers evil every White person existed civil rights movement essentially genocidal lunatic kind racial Original Sin White person internalized racism prejudice unconsciously. Why  people want throw burden guilt  For matter  specifically want throw cursed ancestry  And fact get economic social career benefits pull transition  hurt. What end nation actively despises accomplishmentunless couched victory Western society If nonWhite person something victory racist Whites trying prevent If White person something exercise privilege possible exceptions women homosexuals subminority group. It makes even less sense oldschool communism At least communism theory capitalists holding back production greed incentive exploit labor Communism enters inaugurate fair also technologically advanced system This generates new breed person less grasping healthier productive It  work way never least see people infatuated dream. Under Critical Theoryespecially comes race gendersuccess even possible In Cultural Marxism  oppressed   oppressor  new varieties categories created time goalposts constantly shifting And traditional Western society characterized  oppression  solution constantly promote forms identity break  deconstruct  society. overcoming past never ends There point  equal  everyone start acting normal We simply fight forever And Whites end repentance  Whiteness  Original Sin And unlike Christianity  antiracism  creed church offers salvation. Admit  seen happen Gay groups get criticized heavily White New  phobias  pathologies created seemingly every week Normal behavior love country desire family children pathologized sick oppressive And whereas years ago definition antiracist treating people equally regardless race talking race constantly definition racism. What kind culture created people behaving way  Well typical college know happens Think classes real knowledge least liberal arts downplayed favor endless hunt new forms  oppression.  Think aesthetics radical leftist students actively promote ugliness degeneracy break  social constructs.  Think accomplishments past expressed statues buildings must torn renamed honor  activists  whose accomplishment demand others could build themselves. For us life accomplishment Through power dedication create meaning building something goes beyond But modern Left life tearing everything surrounds And done time insist upon benefits standard living created civilization people despise could never hope equal. When come right modern leftwing college student enjoys subsidized existence decadent anything enjoyed member tsar  court This especially nonWhite students receive set asides government academia And yet LARP grizzled revolutionaries war everything around even key institutions government take side defend them. Under Cultural Marxism  way Americans colors unite people nation Instead modern college war And American society increasingly resembles one giant college endless conflict cease. outcome predictable EuropeanAmericans continue dispossessed despised demoralized eventually destroyed Whatever ideas abstractions institutions value going destroyed You may aware White person matter Your values survive dispossession Look happening college test truth words.
