Whereas New York Intellectuals Frankfurt School felt alienated culture West ones feelings alienation culture strongly influenced Jewish intellectual movements. We dismayed failure media properly address White interests even allow expressions White identity seen heard mainstream media. We well aware failure media selfcensorship powerful campaigns punish guilty parties get recant. Just Frankfurt School theorized West come control soft authoritarianism But shoe foot Power resides soft totalitarianism multicultural multiracial antiWhite Left. Prior ascent power intellectual movements decried passivity escapism conformity American culture Indeed Tom Sunic mentions often stated European clich√© alleged American conformism. Looking present situation would agree Americans conformists Those us White advocates horrified vast majority White Americans passively accept media messages filled distorted images Whites history We appalled many White Americans far interested escapist entertainment ranging sporting events scifi thrillers future people And dismayed conformity great mass White Americans terrified called racist way violating current taboos political correctness We deplore pathetic conformists striving uphold rules society deeply hostile longterm interests. But really different Europe  Quite clearly see conformity moral imperative mass Third World immigration multiculturalism ideology traditional peoples cultures Europe legitimacy For example Sweden enforced silence criticism multiculturalism aboveground media Discussing cancellation talk sponsored politically incorrect newspaper Swedish Ingrid Carlqvist comments That  way works New Sweden country call Absurdistan country silence. Violating silence met moral outrage intended produce shunning ostracism situation Sweden far worse Denmark In Sweden NOBODY talks immigration problems death multiculti project islamisation arabisation Europe If immediately called racist Islamophobe Nazi That called since founded Free Press Society Sweden My name dragged dirt big newspapers like Sydsvenskan Svenska Dagbladet even union paper Journalist. fn fnr title see  In Sweden America nonconforming opinions immediately results ostracism moral reprobate. Rather see culture controlled late capitalist media White advocates see culture West controlled hostile media elite advocates multiculturalism displacement Whites culture Western suicide. There thus common thread Jewish intellectual movements us attempting preserve traditional people culture West We agree importance media control Paraphrasing Bill Clinton campaign slogan It  culture stupid. Control media critical If strong media messages advocating White identity legitimacy White interests things would turn around rather dramatically rather quickly This psychological power behind movement ethnic defense far greater motivation mustered multiracial multiethnic communist revolution. Such media messages would able tap natural wellspring ethnic feeling There deep psychological attachment one  people cultureeven among us individualistic White peoplethat easily motivate mass movement ethnic defense. Often feelings implicit unconscious rather explicit conscious They manifest moving neighborhoods children attend school Whites Or manifest activities able enjoy company camaraderie others like themselves. These feelings real And potentially powerful revolution needed reverse cultural tides last decades would therefore far easier pull Marxist one ardently deasired Frankfurt School. Because Jewish community intimately involved creating therapeutic state noteworthy examine Jewish community responds breaches decorumthat challenges hegemony Here methods quite similar used postWorld War II Germany described Sunic When silencing critics German authorities need resort violent means They usually create cultural smearing campaign whereby cultural heretic portrayed funny pseudoscientific crank merit place mainstream publishing houses Moreover heretic often induced selfmuzzling behavior making impossible portrayal martyr.

And  pretty clear wrong side debate express publicly approval paper denounced elite media antiSemitic. Can anyone believe Alan Dershowitzes world taking names hold dissidents accountable  It  professors  want opine publicpolicy issues When opportunities spout righteous leftism professors leap front line A good example recent case three White men Duke University lacrosse team allegedly gangraped sodomized choked black woman hired stripper party. fn fnr title see Despite considerable evidence charges spurious three academic departments  programs  professors Duke bought ad campus newspaper asserted guilt men stated happened young woman resulted racism sexism. fn fnr title see  But course case professors went public indignation knew part likeminded community would much gain politically correct side little lose proven wrong Indeed university committee charged looking response Duke administration incident recommended hiring minorities order increase diversity Duke administration.

Looking present situation would agree Americans conformists Those us White advocates horrified vast majority White Americans passively accept media messages filled distorted images Whites history We appalled many White Americans far interested escapist entertainment ranging sporting events scifi thrillers future people And dismayed conformity great mass White Americans terrified called racist way violating current taboos political correctness We deplore pathetic conformists striving uphold rules society deeply hostile longterm interests.

There thus common thread Jewish intellectual movements us attempting preserve traditional people culture West We agree importance media control Paraphrasing Bill Clinton campaign slogan It  culture stupid. Control media critical If strong media messages advocating White identity legitimacy White interests things would turn around rather dramatically rather quickly This psychological power behind movement ethnic defense far greater motivation mustered multiracial multiethnic communist revolution. Such media messages would able tap natural wellspring ethnic feeling There deep psychological attachment one  people cultureeven among us individualistic White peoplethat easily motivate mass movement ethnic defense. Often feelings implicit unconscious rather explicit conscious They manifest moving neighborhoods children attend school Whites Or manifest activities able enjoy company camaraderie others like themselves. These feelings real And potentially powerful revolution needed reverse cultural tides last decades would therefore far easier pull Marxist one ardently deasired Frankfurt School. Because Jewish community intimately involved creating therapeutic state noteworthy examine Jewish community responds breaches decorumthat challenges hegemony Here methods quite similar used postWorld War II Germany described Sunic When silencing critics German authorities need resort violent means They usually create cultural smearing campaign whereby cultural heretic portrayed funny pseudoscientific crank merit place mainstream publishing houses Moreover heretic often induced selfmuzzling behavior making impossible portrayal martyr.

And  pretty clear wrong side debate express publicly approval paper denounced elite media antiSemitic.

No other statesman  not Washington  Jefferson  or Lincoln  is deemed worthy of a holiday all to his own . And no other national holiday seems to carry such relevant  pressing meaning for Americans as the third Monday in January . The th of July has become an excuse for a backyard barbecue . The MLK anniversary  on the other hand  inspires Americans to ask who we are and what our higher ideals should be.  p    p  Christmas developed in part from the Saturnalia which was held in Rome on roughly corresponding dates . The Saturnalia was  as it sounds  a celebration in honor of Saturn . One of  p    p  Christmas developed in part from the Saturnalia which was held in Rome on roughly corresponding dates . The Saturnalia was  as it sounds  a celebration in honor of Saturn . One of the most remarkable aspects of the festival manifested itself in the tradition of allowing slaves to rule over masters  at least symbolic.  p    p  Presumably this tradition was related to Saturn  s position vis√†vis a usurping Jupiter . To wit  during the Saturnalia  symbolically  Saturn  the Semitic slave  ruled Jupiter  the Aryan master . The festival was developed  in part  to honor a passed  Golden Age  when Saturn or  clearly  Jews or protoJews ruled.  p    p  That Christmas would develop in part from this tradition is wholly appropriate as both Christ and Saturn are manifestations of the Jewish God or Jewry embodied . But further  the winter in general was understood in the GrecoRoman world as belonging to Bacchus or Dionysus . To wit  it was a time of decadence  degeneracy  darkness and death . Bacchus  likewise  is an important manifestation of the Jewish God as this study explicates.  p    p  Here though  in the nadir of winter  the Winter solstice was also celebrated  signifying the beginning of a return to the spring and summer months . I argue that we  identifying with the solar  are obliged to be  em  above seasons  em   directing them . Hence  in my view  it is a symbolism of limited or dubious value  passive in its tone . For the moment  however  let  s focus on this figure of Saturn.  p    p  In Histories .  Tacitus writes  The Jews are said to have been refugees from the island of Crete who settled in the remotest corner of Libya in the days when  according to the story  Saturn was driven from his throne by the aggression of Jupiter.   p    p  Here  it should be clear to the modern reader  Saturn is being suggested as a personification of the Jewish people in much the way Judah or Yahweh may be understood as a personification of the Jewish people . Likewise  it should be our confident assertion that the expulsion comes at the hands of an Aryan faction personified in Jupiter . Jupiter represents the Aryan force that overthrows the Jewish power to establish a eugenic direction personified in his son Apollo . Hence  technically  it is we  who are Jupiter  while our secured  ameliorating descendants Apollo.  p    p  Regarding their Sabbath Tacitus writes   We are told that the seventh day was set aside for rest because this marked the end of their toilsOthers say that this is a mark of respect to Saturn  either because they owe the basic principles of their religion to the Idaei  who  we are told  were expelled in the company of Saturn and became the founders of the Jewish race  or because  among the seven stars that rule mankind  the one that describes the highest orbit and exerts the greatest influence is Saturn . A further argument is that most of the heavenly bodies complete their path and revolutions in multiples of seven.   a href   znysh       a   p    p  The name Idaei is derived from the name of Mount Ida  the highest mountain in Crete  around which the Idaei dwelt . This was a mountain sacred to the Titaness Rhea or Magna Mater  the sister and wife of Cronus or Saturn . Tacitus likewise relates the speculation that the name Judaei  from which Jew is derived  is  the barbarous lengthening of Idaei.   p    p  Likewise both the ancient Hellenes and the Hebrews would identify Saturn or Cronus with the Semitic El  one of the names used to describe the Jewish God in the Hebrew Bible . Hence  narratively  in the GrecoRoman cosmology  again  the usurpation of this earth god  Saturn  by a sky god  Jupiter  represents the restoration of an Aryan hegemony . To be clear  this does not mean that all of the Titans should be considered racially Semitic  only  to the extent they opposed Jupiter  Jewish dominated and controlled.  p    p  Thus when we understand the chief god of Carthage was Moloch  a href   etp       a  or Saturn  we understand this was an empire under Jewish control  yet perhaps not in all its parts Semitic . After all  for a long period  even if employing vast mercenary forces  it waged war effectively against Rome . Thus  doubtlessly  it retained some meaningful vestigial Aryan element capable of making war against a primarily Aryan Rome  practicing an essentially Aryan Religion.  p    p  Celestial Titans like the Sun Titian Helios  for example  a near Apollo equivalent  may be understood as descriptions of an undiluted or relatively undiluted Aryan remnant within a Judaized regime . Hence figures in the Olympian reign descended from these beings may likewise be understood as descending from undiluted or relatively undiluted Aryan blood . This is true so long as they are not usurping Gods.  p    p   a href   jzll       a  Tacitus   em  Histories  em  .  p    p   a href   fobte       a  Mythologist and archeologists speculate that Moloch  who the ancients identified with Saturn  was an early form of Yahweh . I will have the opportunity to argue that it is better to understand him as another aspect or  emanation  of the Jewish God persisting to this day.  p    p   Joyfully Amor seemed to me to hold my heart in his hand  and held in his arms my lady wrapped in a cloth sleeping .

The explosion of interest in this aspect of supposed AltRight  hate  is  in some sense  both understandable and predictable . Endlessly bewailing the racism of the AltRight in the context of ongoing White decline  mass immigration  and White cultural marginalisation has obvious rhetorical and evidential limits . To put it simply  nonWhites have never had it so good . Whether this fact will gradually bleed  racism  of energy as a galvanizing force for Leftism in the same way that an increase in material wealth among the working classes led to their abandonment by the Left by the s  remains to be seen . Certainly  most Marxists today appear to have abandoned the proletariat as the  privileged emancipatory subject   and have engaged in constructing new hegemonic  chains of equivalences.  This has involved championing  the feminist struggle    the struggle for freedom   and the  struggle for the rights of immigrants   all of which  they imagine  will one day coalesce in one big Struggle.  p    p  There can be little question  however  that  racism  has lost at least some of its shine . Blacks  in particular  appear to be somewhat marginalized by the focus of rhetoric on migrant caravans and amnesties . The Left  always seeking to find or create new victims  also seems particularly energized in recent years by sexual politics  or rather  the politicization of the sexual . Abortion  homosexual marriage  the  right  to AIDS medication  sexual harassment  real or image college rapes  and apparently unending issues of gender identity and orientation are unquestionably ubiquitous in contemporary politics and media . It therefore makes a great deal of tactical sense for the opponents of AltRight thought to attempt to drag the movement into this sphere  even if some of the core matters at issue are more or less peripheral to the central tenets of White identitarian politics.  p    p  One of the main flaws in these recent character assassinations targeting the movement is the blunt and facile method of attempting to interpret what is in fact a complex  varied  and nuanced understanding of relations between the sexes through historical time . This simplistic methodology begins with generalisations about the average male with AltRight political opinions . For example  neglecting the fact that grappling with the  Woman Question  has been a feature of Western civilisation from time immemorial  Pagans and Christians may choose Homer  s Helen or the Biblical Eve as they see fit   at least one apparently legitimate PhD has  a href  https  www.journals.uio.noindex.phpJEAarticleview    b  argued  b   a  that the origins of modern  misogyny  rest in Gamergate and the antics of chan . The only mitigating factor in this instance is probably that the PhD in question  an ethnic Sri Lankan named Udith Dematagoda  is unlikely to possess the requisite tools to appreciate and understand the trajectory of the female in Western history  art  culture  and politics . Less forgivable  perhaps  is Dematagoda  s gleeful but ignorant description of AltRight males as  maladjusted malcontents    peevishly dull obsessives who are prone to tantrums   and  nihilistically perverse basement dwelling jokers.   p    p   img alt   class  sizemedium wpimage aligncenter  height    sizes   maxwidth  px  vw  px  src  wpcontentuploadsDematagodaUdithHQx.jpg  srcset  wpcontentuploadsDematagodaUdithHQx.jpg w  wpcontentuploadsDematagodaUdithHQx.jpg w  wpcontentuploadsDematagodaUdithHQx.jpg w  width       p    p style  textalign  center     em   You  re all nihilistically perverse basement dwelling jokers.   em   p    p  The reality  of course  is that AltRight thought attracts attention and support from a broad crosssection of society  including men from varying professions  countries  socioeconomic positions  and educational backgrounds . But dealing comprehensively with the political and cultural opinions of such a group requires significantly more effort than would be the case with a  nihilistically perverse basement dwelling joker   and so the latter makes for a better straw man to beat with Leftist catchphrases . We are  of course  looking at much more than the reaction of bitter  single  young men to the dynamics of postmodern sexuality  and it  s therefore worthwhile more deeply considering the complexity of the issue of women  sex  and the AltRight . Since these issues did not  in fact  begin with chan  we should turn first to history.  p    p  The quasicannibalistic portion of Dante Alighieri  s opening  i  sonetto  i  from  i  La Vita Nuova  i   composed around    chosen to open this essay  set the tone for the entirety of the text and  also  in some respects for the trajectory of sexual relations in the West for centuries after . Regarded as a classic of literary chivalry or  courtly love    from whence we still derive the mocking term  White Knight   the poem narrates the love of Dante  in his youth  for Beatrice  a woman he loves  admires  and obsesses over from afar . This love is characterised in quite pronounced fashion as painful  hence the vision of the personification of love  Amor  literally feeding Dante  s beating and still warm heart to Beatrice . The conventions of literary courtly love typically follow the pattern of  Attraction to the lady  usually via eyesglance  Worship of the lady from afar  Declaration of passionate devotion  Virtuous rejection by the lady  Renewed wooing with oaths of virtue and eternal fealty  Moans of approaching death from unsatisfied desire  and other physical manifestations of lovesickness   Heroic deeds of valor which win the lady  s heart  Consummation of the secret love  Endless adventures and subterfuges avoiding detection.  p    p   i  La Vita Nuova  i  fulfils only some of these  but is still regarded as the preeminent example of the genre . Dante first sees Beatrice when they are both nine years old  and then a further nine years passes before he sees her again . In both instances he is utterly captivated by the sight of her . For most of the poem he is consumed with the worship of her from afar  but can never muster the composure to approach her directly . He finds himself enduring a number of manifestations of extreme lovesickness  including fainting and fevers . His nervous appearance is mocked by the friends of Beatrice  and then  at the height of Dante  s infatuation  Beatrice dies suddenly  sending him into a spiral of grief and  finally  slow recovery . In this recovery  he resurrects Beatrice as a spiritual ideal  and of course she features prominently in his next work   i  The Divine Comedy  i   where she quite literally guides him to Heaven . The intensity with which this relatively short and simple tale is recounted  along with novel stylistic devices  is one of the major reasons for its enduring position in high culture . In modern times  the tale was the subject of a number of magnificent late th century paintings by notorious womaniser Dante Gabriel Rossetti  as well as a short but remarkable operatic piece  Vide Cor Meum    See my Heart   by the Irish composer Patrick Cassidy that was subsequently in the score for the Ridley Scott films  i  Hannibal  i  and  i  Kingdom of Heaven  i  .  p    p  Dante  s  i  La Vita Nuova  i  marked  simultaneously  both a new departure from contemporary sexual conventions  and a return to older  primal attitudes regarding the female . Courtly love  according to most historians and literary scholars  was always rooted more in fiction than reality . It was a development fostered by poetaristocrats who sought to imbue certain chaste women  and relationships with them  with a metaphysical aura  often with religious or spiritual overtones . In doing so  the poetaristocrats in some sense returned to the old Roman pagan notion of  i  pudicitia  i   restraint or chastity  as contributing to the spiritual elevation of the female  i  .  i  A woman with a high degree of  i  pudicitia  i  typically sought to appear modest at all times and to limit her social interactions with men other than her husband and male relatives . Psychologist Neel Burton  a href  https  www.psychologytoday.comgbbloghideandseeklovesexandmarriageinancientrome    b  remarks  b   a  that   i  Pudicitia  i  stood for reason and control  whereas impudicitiathat is  shamelessness and sexual vice  struprum   sex crime   stood for chaos and disaster . A univira  oneman woman  was held in high esteem and even idealized  with the emperor Augustus   BC AD  going so far as to enact a programme of legislation to promote the notion and its observance.  Sex  women  order  and the divine were inextricable   p    p  The Romans sought to control female sexuality to protect the family and  by extension  social order  prosperity  and the state . They crystallized these notions in the cult of Venus  the mother of Aeneas  founder of Rome  and in the Vestal Virgins  the priestesses of the hearth goddess Vesta  who would be buried alive if convicted of fornication . To violate a Vestal Virgin  s vow of chastity was to commit an act of religious impurity  incestum   and thereby to undermine Rome  s compact with the gods  the pax deorum   peace of the gods   . Roman religion very much reflected and regulated sexual mores.  p    p   img alt   class  sizemedium wpimage aligncenter  height    sizes   maxwidth  px  vw  px  src  wpcontentuploadsdscfmidx.jpg  srcset  wpcontentuploadsdscfmidx.jpg w  wpcontentuploadsdscfmid.jpg w  width       p    p  The Roman ideal of the female  of course  coexisted with a tendency among some to debauchery . It also coexisted with a stoic  ultrarational view of sex and relationships bluntly exemplified in Marcus Aurelius  s observation that sex was nothing more than  the friction of a piece of gut and  following a sort of convulsion  the expulsion of some mucus.  Further  it drew upon the perennial  primordial  and quasimetaphysical position of the female body in the male mind . As Jonathan Bowden once remarked in his  a href  https  agkistrodonpiscivorus.wordpress.comjonathanbowdenontehgay    b  classic chastisement of movement homosexualists  b   a    p    p  A primal sexuality always embodies Heterosexuality . It alone relates to blood  genetics  racial causation and gender  s polarity . All culture springs from a child  s birth  it  s in accordance with Nature . A factor which necessitates the weakness of all alternatives  whether these are samesex  infantilistic or paedophile  bipolar  necrophile  coprophiliac  transgender or hermaphroditic  et cetera  All sexual beauty has to be female given the divinity of the woman  s body . Without it there  s nothing  in terms of Erotica  s stream of consciousness  When one considers threedimensional art  Rodin  s The Muse  Cybele or Aristide Malliol  s study for Action in Chains  one recognises the Anima at work . For representation of the female corpus is cardinal to mental creativity in many fields . In Hellenistic art  the Aphrodite of Melos  more commonly known as the Venus of Milo  glistens in its marble splendour in the Louvre . But even this doesn  t do justice to the subliminal eroticism given off by this work.  p    p  Schopenhauer  of course  famously attempted a rebuttal to such assertions in his essay  i  On Women  i   where he argued  p    p  Only a male intellect clouded by the sexual drive could call the stunted  narrowshouldered  broadhipped  and shortlegged sex the fair sex  for it is with this drive that all its beauty is bound up . More fittingly than the fair sex  women could be called the unaesthetic sex . Neither for music  nor poetry  nor the plastic arts do they possess any real feeling or receptivity.  p    p  The problems with Schopenhauer  s account include his criticism that concepts of beauty should be linked to the sexual drive  why shouldn  t it    which is of course primed to seek markers of fertility and genetic health . Schopenhauer  s implied markers of a concept of beauty  unclouded  by the sexual drive  longlimbed  broadshouldered  narrowhipped  are at best asexual and genetically counterpropositional . That such an injunction should arise from an essentially antilife philosopher who promoted suicide is probably not coincidental . His conflation of female physicality as muse and the female intellect as incapable of producing art is simply ridiculous  a sunset can not paint on canvas  but it can inspire countless canvasses  and we do not fear to call it beautiful . But perhaps the worst condemnation of Schopenhauer  s deconstructive approach to female beauty and the sexual drive was the blatant hypocrisy behind it . In his youth  the German philosopher was infatuated  in the style of Dante  with Karoline Jagemann  even writing her love poetry . He had a number of sexual affairs with  women of lower social status  such as servants  actresses  and sometimes even paid prostitutes   admitted to two children born outofwedlock  and confessed to at least one friend that he was often frustrated by a lack of sexual success with as great a number of women as he  d prefer . We might say that Schopenhauer  while correct in some of his assertions elsewhere in his essay  was personally caught in the tension between ideals and debauchery  between Dante and Tinder  and the result was a curious antifemale embitterment that in the end went beyond the rational and the reasonable.  p    p  Returning to  i  La Vita Nuova  i   the advent of courtly  and later romantic  love revisited existing tensions and contradictions regarding the female in the West  and also embellished the notion of the holy  chaste  yet erotic and captivating female . Crucially  however  the courtly love ideal also undermined the need for order that had been present in pagan Rome . The rise of Christianity led to the concept of order being taken to an absolute extreme  and to a medieval culture in which marital sex was viewed as a concession  not as a right or even a gift from God . Sex and relationships were therefore scheduled to ensure the most possible procreation and the least possible pleasure . Even children conceived during a period where the couple should have abstained  mainly based on the liturgical calendar and the wife  s reproductive cycle  were considered bastards . Ironically  Dante and the courtly poets overcame this mechanistic approach to love and sex in order to elevate sexuality itself to an ideal  but in doing so paved the very path for its decline and degradation . Schultz observes   p    p  In the history of European thinking on these matters  the gradual shift from an ideology of sex for procreation to an ideology of sex for pleasure is one of the most important longterm developments . Courtly love represents an important milestone in that shift  a secular ruling class advances an ideal of amorous relations in which making love requires no justification other than the joy and high spirits it brings the persons involved . The desire for children is not required to excuse the lovers  pleasures . Indeed  they never think of procreation and no one expects them to do so . The institution of marriage  whether sacred or secular  is not necessary to legitimize their embraces . The joy and high spirits that lovers feel when they make love are all the justification needed.  p    p   James A. Schultz   i  Courtly Love  the love of Courtliness  and the History of Sexuality  i   Chicago  University of Chicago Press        p    p  The notion of a culture that promotes and idealizes the female while simultaneously paving the path for her decline and degradation should sound very familiar  and the reason for this is that the  Woman Question   such as it exists  has been unresolved and is likely to remain so . What really marks the difference between our own era and prior ages is the abandonment of any need of a rationale for a metaphysical elevation of the female  and the wholesale expansion and embracing of the  courtly  literary fiction of  love for love  s sake  which has led to a proliferation of promiscuity and  in turn  the commonplace acceptance of homosexuality . Expressed in simple terms  today there are no criteria for a woman to be considered special  modesty or  i  pudicitia  i    all women are assumed to be metaphysically important and fundamentally special  regardless of background or how many previous  loves  they have cycled through.  p    p  Much of contemporary sexual politics has two lives  the lived reality and the reported fiction . Mainstream media accounts of modern sex and sexuality perpetuate the relatively unsophisticated doxa of a  crisis in masculinity.  This phrasing is deceptive because it implies that the increasingly degraded state of Western sexuality is really only bad for men  and that if men would just accept the fall of patriarchy we  d all be much happier . We can  of course  concede that certain significant aspects of the postmodern sociocultural context are extremely bad for men . The divorce system is bad for men . The child custody system is bad for men . The sexual habits of women in postmodernity are bad for a lot of men  though it must be conceded they benefit a minority of men seeking shortterm sexual gratification  . We can see the results in the shocking suicide statistics among males  and the increasingly poor performance of young males at school . There is undoubtedly a crisis among males . But whether the degraded state of Western sexuality  in a broader sense  affects males so exclusively that the terminology of a  crisis in masculinity  is appropriate as an overarching explanation of modern sexual politics is less clear . The crisis may in fact be said to embrace men and women equally  and modern sexuality as a whole  because the disease is essentially systemic in the feministic foundations of postmodern liberalism  even if the mass media is simultaneously convincing women  often barely  that they are liberated  free  successful  satisfied  and fulfilling a greater destiny than motherhood and the domestic setting might offer them.  p    p   img alt   class  sizemedium wpimage aligncenter  height    sizes   maxwidth  px  vw  px  src  wpcontentuploadsdrunkbx.jpg  srcset  wpcontentuploadsdrunkbx.jpg w  wpcontentuploadsdrunkb.jpg w  width       p    p  All factual indicators prove that women have  liberated  themselves into despair .

This is the liberated female of postmodernity  stripped of  i  pudicitia.  i   p    p  Postmodernity has also stripped the female of the erotic mystery of metaphysical quality that has featured so heavily in her historical trajectory . We have moved  as it were  from Dante to Tinder . As Roger Scruton has observed  the saturation of culture with the  i  sexual  i  has bleached it of metaphysical speculation and genuinely  i  erotic  i  potential . The same enthralling female form that inspired Rodin  s The Muse or Aristide Malliol  s study for Action in Chains has been demystified and crudely embarrassed by the rutting baseness of ubiquitous pornography  the primary object of which is not to raise the female bodily form to spiritual heights but rather to subjugate and debase it . The Irish comedian Dara O  Brien once remarked that he couldn  t watch pornography primarily because it seemed  full of angry people   a telling commentary on a cultural product that is probably as much about venting frustrations on women  and seeing them punished after a fashion  as personal sexual titillation.  p    p  Since  as Roger Scruton argues in  i  Sexual Desire  A Philosophical Investigation  i      sexual mystery is an important component of normal heterosexual relations  the stripping of sexuality of this component  along with cultural negation of differences in the sexes  lends it qualities normally associated with the homosexual  promiscuity  indifference to the other  narcissism  and predation.  p    p   img alt   class  sizemedium wpimage aligncenter  height    sizes   maxwidth  px  vw  px  src  wpcontentuploadsmaxresdefaultx.jpg  srcset  wpcontentuploadsmaxresdefaultx.jpg w  wpcontentuploadsmaxresdefaultx.jpg w  wpcontentuploadsmaxresdefaultx.jpg w  wpcontentuploadsmaxresdefault.jpg w  width       p    p  Scruton  who deemed homosexuality a perversion from a moral philosophical standpoint  remarks on the necessary inherent tension and complementarity of heterosexual relations   Male desire evokes the loyalty which neutralises its vagrant impulse  female desire evokes the conquering urge which overcomes its hesitations.  Damage to the heterosexual features of loyalty and hesitation  most notably in the case of culturally sanctioned or promoted promiscuity  eventually lead to a collapse of cultural tension and eroticism in the sphere of the sexual . Scruton calls this the  decline in the sentiment of sex.   p    p  One of the fundamental problems in postmodern sexuality is that women lay claim to all the privileges  respect  and admiration associated in earlier eras with  i  pudicitia  i  without fulfilling its requirements or contributing to social order  and often in fact undermining it  . We witness a proliferation of scenarios in which a Stormy Daniels lays claim to being treated as a Beatrice . But the days of forlornly admiring a demure beauty from afar are surely gone  cheaply replaced by gazing at the pouting  photoshopped visage of a common trollop advertising her wares on a dating app  no longer soliciting love poems and feverish protestations of undying love  but now a succession of repetitive chatup lines and  dick pics.  Women  or I suppose lovers of both sexes in general  are no longer experienced by each other  but consumed  with all the attending eventual and inevitable obsolescence the latter term implies . This begs the question as to the role of women in an increasingly barren  infertile culture saturated with intercourse   the friction of a piece of gut and  following a sort of convulsion  the expulsion of some mucus   but devoid of the sentiment of sex.  p    p  The AltRight  s grappling with this question has provoked the aforementioned accusations of misogyny  based on the erroneous  and often duplicitous  assumption that the crisis in modern sexuality is merely the problem of a handful of frustrated basementdwellers unable to secure a girlfriend   a crisis in masculinity  experienced only by the  sexually unsuccessful.  But  as has been discussed  the postmodern West as a whole is sexually unsuccessful  being more neurotic than erotic  and inducing the sexes to hate each other while producing STDs faster than it produces children . The grappling of the AltRight  the manosphere  and similar tributaries of thought have resulted variously in support for MGTOW  Men Going Their Own Way   the bitter repudiations of the Incels  semiironic calls for  White Sharia   and  at the more moderate end  a call for the return to more traditional gender roles and the  for lack of a better term   redomestication  of the Western woman . These strands of thought have all been denounced as expressions of hatred of women when  in fact  they are the expression  with greater or lesser success  of the desire to make women loveable  admirable  cherishable  even metaphysical again . It is a desire  if not to move from Tinder back to Dante  then to at least return to a period in which an almost spiritual respect for  i  pudicitia  i  lifted the female beyond the bitter descriptions of Schopenhauer.  p    p  This desire is often the case even despite the most superficially antiwoman phrasing of these various movements because  at heart  their stated goals involve restoring Woman to a state in which she was in fact admired in such a fashion . MGTOW is not so much a statement of hatred of the female as an admission that the man going his own way finds it impossible to love and commit to Woman  i  in her present state and in the current culture  i  . Pickup artistry is merely the nihilistic response to Woman  i  in her present state and in the current culture  i   in which the male concedes that the sentiment of sex is gone  and with it the prospect of meaningful marriage and family  but seeks to reap as much intercourse as can be obtained from the debauched and demystified females of postmodernity . The Incels acknowledge bitterly the fact they are the prime casualties of Woman  i  in her present state and in the current culture  i   enduring sexual disenfranchisement as a consequence of the decline of monogamy and the economic impact of feminism . The advocates for  White Sharia   and increased control over the behavior of women  are disillusioned by Woman  i  in her present state and in the current culture  i   and are merely seeking the most radical form of reversal . Those seeking the  redomestication  of the female are similarly disappointed with the position of Woman  i  in her present state and in the current culture  i   and believe in the promotion of family values and wifely attributes as a corrective . Whether through gentle inducement or strict control  all groups are essentially unanimous in seeking the reinstatement of  i  pudicitia  i  in the life of Western women.  p    p  The actual feasibility of such schemes  even in the most extreme case  evades clarity . The demystification of Woman  such as has been witnessed over the last century  is unprecedented in the history of our culture . It may in fact be the case that feminism has brought the Western female to her lowest level of esteem among her male peers than at any time in history . Reversing this process  going from Tinder to Dante  seems nigh impossible . What has been seen  as they say  can not be unseen . Any process of  remystification  in order to revive the sentiment of sex would almost certainly take generations to achieve  and would at the very least require the reintroduction of social controls concerning promiscuity  the elevation of  i  pudicitia  i  and marriage  i   i  to a place of high sociocultural esteem  the strict regulation or abolition of pornography as an industry  the remarginalization of homosexuality and the banning of homosexual marriages of all kinds  an end to abortion on demand  and  finally  the cultural celebration of essential gender  i  differences  i  .  p    p  Nietzsche  the JudeoChristian Legacy  and European Unification Note I first wrote this essay in the winter of   as part of my graduate study at Duke University .

The course was  Nietzsche  s Politics   taught by Michael Gillespie in the Political Science Department . I have maintained the essay substantially as it was when I handed it in . Much honing has taken place  for clarity  flow  and depth  but the structure is unchanged.  p    p  I had first encountered Nietzsche  s writings in the year  in my extracurricular readings while an undergraduate at the University of Virginia . Reading him marked a turning point in my life  indeed  I find it hard to imagine what my approach to thinking about society  politics  and religion would be without Nietzsche as educator . Writing isn  t just a form of communication  but a process of discovery for the author . Composing this essay some  years ago  I was moving beyond a raw  youthful understanding of Nietzsche  s critiques of Christian morality  democracy  and the modern age  and towards his deeper  in many ways   em  hidden  em  vision for the transformation of the world . Everybody knows that Nietzsche said  God is dead   few recognize  em  why  em  and  em  how  em  this catastrophe occurred  what the consequences will be  and how European man can overcome this event.  p    p  This essay is about politics . Nietzsche  of course  never put forth any straightforward  political program   though his works are littered with sharp opinions on the passing scene . He does  however  develop a  em  metapolitics  em  . This is not  political science  in the sense that it is used today  but politics understood from the standpoint of the transcendent . It is the European crisisthe end game of the JudeoChristian legacy  the death of Godthat births the  good Europeans  and  artist tyrants  who  Nietzsche expects  will rule the continent  p    p  Revisiting this essay now  it strikes me as unfinished . There are many tantalizing threads that should be followed further and more flesh put on the bone . I  m in the process of expanding it as part of a book  which will result in its doubling in size . I thought it would be appropriate  however  to publish the original essay  em  as is  em   so as to give readers an understanding of my thoughtprocess and development.  p    p  The  em  EthnoState  em  has just now entered the popular lexicon  sparking predictable outrage  some productive debate  and no small amount of confusion . The term itself  along with many of its components  I borrowed from the American writer Wilmot Robertson . The deeper character of the EthnoState  as I view it  is Nietzschean at its core .

The fact that Nietzsche chose to image Romeand specifically  em  not  em  Athensin what is ultimately a kind of  political testament  goes against much that is taken for granted in Nietzsche scholarship.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  There is  of course  good reason for this . In Nietzsche first book   em  The Birth of Tragedy  em      he posited the tragic age of Aeschylus and Sophocles as the unreachable standard of cultural achievement . Even if he later came to view many of his claims in this volume as  embarrassing   BT P      it seems reasonable to assume that Athens remained for him a political icon.  p    p  Nietzsche  s most important writings on Greek culture came at a point in his life when he was most overtly politically engaged  and his attitude towards thcentury Athens should be understood within that context .  em  The Birth of Tragedy  em  was written in the wake of German national unification  which occurred months before its publication . And at this time  Nietzsche was  effectively  a German nationalist  he distanced himself from militarism and was critical of the state  but he was a nationalist nonetheless . Nietzsche imaged Germany  s rise to greatness not only through military victory over the French but through a revived cultural spirit . He  in  famously claimed    F  or it is only as an  em  aesthetic phenomenon  em  that existence and the world are eternally  em  justified  em    BT    and for him  the political achievements of both thcentury Athens and thcentury Germany would be measured though their cultural output . In this line  it was Kant and Schopenhauer who were  in Nietzsche  s eyes  courageous enough to  critique reason   to adumbrated aspects of existence outside Socratean rationality . They thereby introduced  an infinitely profounder and more serious view of ethical problems and art which we may designate as Dionysian wisdom comprised in concepts   BT   . They were  in this way  able to approach the tragic wisdom of Aeschylus . This new  em  Weltanschauung  em  would find expression in Wagner  s musicdramasthe combination of the Apollonian heroic outlook with Dionysian  infinite melody  to be performed publicly at the annual Bayreuth festival.  p    p  On all levels  Nietzsche understood this new cultural project to be ethnonationalist in character   p    p   W  e have the feeling that the birth of a tragic age simply means a return to itself of the German spirit  a blessed rediscovery after powerful intrusive influences had for a long time compelled it . . . being attached to the lead strings of a  em  Romanic civilization  em   BT   emphasis added   .  p    p  Anticipating the deification of German  em  Kultur  em  at the expense of Western  French  em  Zivilization  em  in the s and  s  Nietzsche here imagines the triumph of the German spirit as specifically  em  antiimperial  em  in character  it would be a great throwing off of the legacy of Rome  Christianity  and the supraethnic  supranational institutions that had defined  Europe  for two millennia.  p    p  By Nietzsche  s middle and late periods  much had changed . Far from being an ethnonationalist  Nietzsche filled these writings with numerous barbs and insults against all things German . In terms of philosophy and culture  Nietzsche claims that the  origin of the German Spirit  is not Kant and Schopenhauer but beerguzzling and  distressed intestines   EH II    . Wagner and Bayreuth become an expression of decadencean opera festival for philistines and the  em  nouveau riche  em   not a rebirth of tragedy . Politically  he came to reject unequivocally Bismarck  Wilhelm I  and the Reich . In turn  Nietzsche  s stance towards the Greeks also changed . Although a deep admiration never waned  Athenian culture no longer served as a touchstone and cultural model in these writings . By his final productive years  Nietzsche had become almost disenchanted  with the exception of Thucydides  Nietzsche reports to have lost interest in the literature of ancient Athens . Historical models were dramatically redefined    The Greeks   em  can not  em  mean as much to us as the Romans   TI X    . On one level  Nietzsche  s turn from Athens  and Bayreuth  to Rome is indicative of an interest in moving beyond the  em  polis  em  and  em  ethnos  em   the two most fundamental concepts of Greek politics and cultural identity  in favor of imperial hegemony and a synthesis of European ethnicities . In a way  Nietzsche  s imperialism can be seen as an outgrowth of his earlier cultural nationalism  dreams of German unification were morphing into dreams of a German empire.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup   p    p  On another level  Nietzsche  s transformation marks a move from art to politicsor rather a view that politics was the grandest genre of art of them all . A culture can not be justified solely by culture  whether Attic Tragedy or Wagnerian musicdrama  instead  Nietzsche begins to view culture as arising in the shadow of the state . The state itself becomes the centerpiece of all cultural  social  and intellectual development . Nietzsche remarks that  the grand style  that is  the imperial political structureis  no longer mere art but  has  become reality  truth   em  life  em    AC    . Not Athens . . . not Bayreuth . . . but Rome.  p    p  It is not difficult to cull sundry political opinions from out Nietzsche  s texts and discover what he thought about public intellectuals like David Strauss and Heinrich von Treitschke  not to mention Bismarck and the Kaiser . But then Nietzsche famously called himself the  last  em  antipolitical  em  German   EH I     and he did not formulate anything resembling a political program or  pragmatic  agenda . Reconstructing such things risks wishful thinking or forgery . Where Nietzsche does sustain a discussion of politics  his  political philosophy  is often grandiose bordering on the fantastical . Unconcerned with the vagaries of parliamentary majorities or policyanalysis  Nietzsche instead focused on  Cesare Borgia as Pope  and the creation of a new aristocracy . At other times  when Nietzsche discusses politics  he seems to actually be concerned with something else . As Tracy Strong observes   The one attempt Nietzsche makes at providing a unified perspective  em  explicitly  em  on politics . . . to our confusion  is essentially a discussion of music   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  . Still  as the above discussion of Athens and Rome reveals  politics are extremely important to Nietzsche and inform  if always subtly  his wider philosophy.  p    p  Throughout the th century  interpretations of Nietzsche  s political thought have  generally speaking  shifted between two poles and  . First  there is the Nietzsche of  will to power    the overman    the blond beast    the antiChrist   a thinker who is an opponent of democracy  the herd  and modernity itself.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  But on the other hand  there is the Nietzsche of immoralism  selfcreation   life as a work of art   a thinker who becomes the forefather of Foucault  Derrida  and much of the postmodern Left.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  Both of these political interpretations seem equally right and wrong . The main problem is that associating Nietzsche with political movements with which he was never involved blocks consideration of his political philosophy on its own terms . Not coincidentally  these kinds of interpretations have also blocked serious consideration of what Nietzsche explicitlythough always ellipticallyclaims to be the  politics of the future  Europeanism.  p    p  By   Nietzsche was already speaking of himself and his equals as   em  good Europeans  em   Europe  s heirs  the rich superabundant  but also abundantly obligated heirs of two millennia of the European spirit   GS V    .  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  A year earlier  his disenchantment with nationalism was explicit and he had already formulated the basis of a supranational project   p    p  Owing to the pathological estrangement which the insanity of nationality has induced  and still induces  among the peoples of Europe  owing also to the shortsightedness and quickhanded politicians who are at the top today with the help of this insanity  without any inkling that their separatist policies can of necessity only be  em  entr  acte  em  policies  owing to all this and much else that today simply can not be said  the most unequivocal portents are now being overlooked  or arbitrarily and mendaciously reinterpretedthat  em  Europe wants to become one  em  .  BGE VIII     p    p  German ethnonationalism was expunged from Nietzsche  s consciousness . While in  em  The Birth of Tragedy  em   he speaks of German particularism breaking out from under the  servitude  of  Romanic Civilization   by his mature period  he stresses the need for a new supranational order . Nietzsche discounts ethnicity and goes as far as to imagine the possibilities  and dangers  of a  new synthesis  the mixing of the European races . During the writing of  em  The Birth of Tragedy  em   Nietzsche was a prominent member of the ideologically antiSemitic  Bayreuth Circle  surrounding Richard Wagner  though it is not clear that Nietzsche ever shared all of their views  . After his break  Nietzsche began to praise the Jews a ripe for the  mastery over Europe  and as powerful precisely through their  nomadic   international culture  BGE VIII      .  p    p  But even if it is uncontroversial that in Nietzsche  s mature thought he embraced a kind of Europeanism  the question remains of exactly  em  why  em  . Without doubt  Nietzsche did not support  Europe  and reject ethnonationalism and antiSemitismout of a sense of  liberalism    tolerance   or  multiculturalism.  To the contrary  Nietzsche wanted the opposite of these things and even described the potential leaders of Europe as  tyrants   BGE VIII    . Nietzsche was first and foremost a philosopher  and he adopted a political philosophy out of philosophic necessity .  Politics in the grand style  did not emerge from an ideology  at least in the simplistic sense of the term  nor from blind pragmatism . Instead  as I hope to demonstrate  Nietzsche forges his politics in the realm of the transcendental  as a response to a cultural and spiritual crisis on the continenta crisis that affects not only politics but theology  epistemology  and aesthetics.  p    p  In  em  Ecce Homo  em      Nietzsche mentions that his mother  Franziska Oehler  married his father in Eilenburg in   the  great war year  in which Napoleon entered the city . Nietzsche relates that   As a Saxon  she was a great admirer of Napoleon  it could be that I still am  too   EH I    . It is certainly not a stretch to say that the  em  empereur  em  and his attempted unification of Europe represent for Nietzsche a manifestation of the imperial politics he most admired  and  in many ways  Nietzsche  s view of Napoleon encapsulates the way  great politics  functions within his philosophy . It is important to note that Nietzsche  s esteem for Napoleon should not be viewed as mere  hero worship  or as an example of  Great Man history.  Nietzsche never admired Napoleon for his skill in getting to the top  that is  for his  will to power  in the most individualistic and simplistic of meanings . Napoleon instead represents for Nietzsche a culmination of cultural energies   The history of Napoleon  s reception is almost the history of the highest happiness attained by the whole century in its most valuable human beings and moments  BGE V    . As the French Revolution inaugurated the zenith of democratic leveling  and popular  em  ressentiment  em    Nietzsche viewed Napoleon as a kind of  signpost to the  em  other  em  path   that of the great and terrible aristocracy of antiquity and the Italian Renaissance . Napoleon was not important for Nietzsche as a  French patriot  and less so as a great individual  he held meaning as a realization of the spirit  Napoleon was  the problem of the  em  noble ideal as such  em  made flesh . . . the synthesis of the  em  inhuman  em  and the  em  superhuman  em   GM I    .  p    p  Just as Napoleon embodied a cultural problem  Nietzsche formulates his definition of  great politics  around what he perceives as a Europeanwide spiritual and cultural crisis . In describing  why I am a destiny   Nietzsche imagines  politics in the grand style  as encompassing both the terrible truth that Nietzsche  s philosophy announces to the world and the  war of spirits  that must follow   p    p  For when truth enters into a fight with the lies of millennia  we shall have upheavals  a convulsion of earthquakes  a moving of mountains and valleys  the like of which has never been dreamed of . The concept of politics will have merged entirely with a war of spirits  all power structures of the old society will have been explodedall of them are based on lies  there will be wars the like of which have never yet been seen on earth . It is only beginning with me that the earth knows  em  great politics  em  .  EC IV     p    p  This is a particularly pregnant passage  and it is related to a number of concerns of this essay . For now  it is important to recognize that Nietzsche views  great politics  as emerging directly from a crisis of his age . In announcing the demise of the basic structures of European society  Nietzsche sees himself as unleashing  great politics   a kind of combination of actual war and a contestation of value.  p    p  What Nietzsche views as comprising his  truth  against  the lies of millennia  is  at its core  his announcement that  God is dead.   p    p  Those who only know one thing about Nietzsche usually know the halftruth that he loathed Christianity and was a militant atheist . While it is true that Nietzsche did present himself as  the Antichrist   to say that Nietzsche was writing polemically  em  against  em  Christianitylike some protoChristopher Hitchensis to misconstrue him entirely . Nietzsche hardly thought that the Europeans of the futureperhaps led by a few  overmen  who had read  em  Thus Spoke Zarathustra  em  could recognize the faults of Christianity and then simply  get rid of it.  To think so is to vastly underestimate the complexityand  indeed  the  em  ambivalence  em  of Nietzsche  s critique . Nietzsche did not view JudeoChristianity  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  and its legacy as mere  lies  as the  opium of the masses  in Marx  s language or the  God Delusion   to borrow a phrase from the selfstyled  New Atheists.  He viewed Christianity much like a traditional conservativeas the most basic grounding of what has come to be called  The West.  To actually oppose JudeoChristianityas Nietzsche imagines himself as doing in the passage from  em  Ecce Homo  em  is not only to risk catastrophe but also all assurance of a future . As I will demonstrate below  Nietzsche questioned the very ability of Europeans to think outside the confines of the JudeoChristian tradition . Simply exiting Christianity  or transcendent thinking in general  was not an option.  p    p  Europeans had not simply  lost faith.  God is dead because the  the belief in the Christian God has become unbelievable   GS V    . Put into other words  the Human and Natural Sciences   Enlightenment  in the broadest sense  pursued its  will to know  to the point that it shattered the religious basis of European societies . What remains most important about this conception is that Nietzsche specifically does not view Enlightenment and the  will to know  as emerging from a system of knowledge and values outside or alien to JudeoChristianity . Nietzsche would never deny that the Sciences were often set opposed to the Church  and viceversa   however  for him  the  will to know  lies at the center of the JudeoChristian tradition.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  Moreover  as I will discuss below   truth  functions within JudeoChristianity in a way that differs in prominence and quality from other historical religions.  p    p  In this line  Nietzsche  s supranationalismhis Europeanismis directly linked to his expansive view of the influence of JudeoChristianity . It is specifically Europe  s struggle with its Christian legacy that generates  great politics  and the need for a radical transformation . Nietzsche claims that the JudeoChristian tradition has  created in Europe a magnificent tension of the spirit the like of which had never yet existed on earth  with so tense a bow we can now shoot for the most distant goals   BGE P  . It is this  tension  Europe  s turning against itselfthat can launch it into greater heights.  p    p  But even if JudeoChristianity  s tension with the Enlightenment generates the European crisis  Nietzsche does not believe in the least that Enlightened politicsspecifically nationalism  democracy  and liberalismare well suited to address the problem . For Nietzsche  when a culture is in crisis  it must turn to  the grand style  in order to  unbend the bow.  Nietzsche seeks to construct a new kind of aristocratic politics that would not simply be  antiChristian  but mark a transformation of the tradition . The  good Europeans  the new masters and tyrants of the continentwill rise to power  not in polemical opposition to JudeoChristianity  but by embodying the productive contradictions and antagonisms of its legacy.  p    p  Few thinkers have been as selfconsciously hostile towards their age and milieu as Nietzsche . Fewer still have felt themselves to be so out of place  to have been literally born at the wrong time . In  em  Ecce Homo  em   Nietzsche presents himself as an  em  epigone  em   as the  presumably last   disciple of the god Dionysius.  This contrasts sharply with the  em  forward  em  orientation in many of his other writings in which he claims to be a John the Baptist of  the philosophy of the future.  Perhaps Nietzsche is most honest when he critically admits that he is a product of his own age   I am a decadent   EH I    .  p    p  Without doubt  Nietzsche  s profound alienation from late thcentury European culture had many personal causes  his various health problems  rejection by his peers  and the absence of adequate companionship being but a few . But far more importantly  Nietzsche  s particular animus towards European society resulted from the fact that he felt he knew his age  em  all too well  em  . More specifically  he believed himself to be fully aware of a cultural crisis beyond comparison  the consequences and implications of which would change utterly all facets of Europe . Being born both too early and too late  Nietzsche saw himself  stretched in the contradiction between today and tomorrow   GS V    . As Cassandra  he foresees the coming catastrophe  as John the Baptist  he glimpse a new dawn.  p    p  An exact and concise description of the European crisis is difficult to put into words simply because Nietzsche develops this theme in a wide variety of manifestations . For the purpose of this essay  it is useful to look at a particularly poignant image of the crisis from the middle of Nietzsche  s careerhis announcement of the  death of God  and the formation of  shadows over Europe   GS V    .  p    p  It is of great importance to understand that Nietzsche  s famous announcement that God is dead is actually far more  em  anthropological  em  and  em  phenomenological  em  than it is theological . In Werner Dannhauser  s words  Nietzsche practices  historical atheism    The saying that God is dead implies that God once existed . God existed while one could believe in God  God is dead because belief in God has become impossible.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  The vital questions thus become   em  Why did God die   em  and  em  Who killed him   em  Nietzsche  s full formulation is that  God is dead . God remains dead . And  em  we  em  have killed him  emphasis added    GS    . We killed him not simply through our loss of faith  for fervency comes and goes and can be lost and regained . Saying  scientists  or  atheists  killed God is equally unsatisfactory  for science as mere technical mastery does not touch the soul . God died over the course of the series of tumults that cut off European man from the transcendent . Copernicus removed him from the center of the cosmos . . . Galileo discovered that natural laws hold in the celestial spheres just as much as they do on Earth . . . Darwin demonstrated that man emerged from out of brutality and death . . . Individuals and specific discoveries are not important  as no single person killed God . And Nietzsche does not posit an aggressive  atheism  as a motivating factor  to the contrary  the scientists mentioned above were inspired by Christian faith . But to go on believing in the Christian God in the face of the modern experience was  for Nietzsche  a sign of childishness  denial  and cowardice . Nietzsche does not view natural  Enlightenment  as the highest form of wisdom  but he never underestimated its immense  catastrophic power.  p    p  Though the bad news has not yet been heeded by all  Nietzsche  and a select few  grasp that the death of the Christian God will be followed by the collapse of  the whole of our European morality.  Furthermore  the end of faith will instigate a  sequences of breakdown   culminating in the destruction of the institutions and values based upon the JudeoChristian moral system . The th century will witness nothing less than the eclipse of the sun.  p    p  In making such claims  Nietzsche might seem to have much in common with the pessimism of many conservatives of the late th century  and today   who viewed the end of faith as equally disastrous  and sometimes in equally grandiose terms . Yet Nietzsche  s perspective on the death of God is wholly different than that of such figures . Firstly  Nietzsche viewed the coming catastrophe as necessary  even if all of Europe does not yet recognize it  there is no hope for a Christian revival  for such a thing would inherently ring hollow . Nietzsche would not have been surprised by the decent of mainstream Christianity into selfesteem doctrines or community organizing.  p    p  Secondly  while the death of God is a disaster  Nietzsche sees it as containing great potential benefit . As stressed by Michael Allen Gillespie  what Nietzsche most opposed in Christianity is that it leads Europeans into believing that  after the collapse of Christian morality  life in general would have no meaning . But Nietzsche instead envisioned other types of men who  although disturbed by the death of God  accept the dilemma and learn to view it as an opportunity for a cultural transformation.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  In this line  Nietzsche  s tone in this aphorism moves from despairing to rhapsodic . The  shadows over Europe  lift to reveal a  new dawn   and Nietzsche shifts to a new set of metaphors  imaging the  death of God  as a starting point for great new voyages of the spirit . Writing as one of the  free spirits  who understands the positive aspect of the collapse  Nietzsche ironically entitles Aphorism   The Meaning of our Cheerfulness.   p    p  Such passages deserve serious criticism on many levels.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  First and foremost  as pointed out by Gillespie  one might counter that Nietzsche vastly overrated the degree to which the European world would sink into suicidal  nihilistic despair . Although the years  might seem a fulfillment of Nietzsche  s prophecy   If the intervening years have proven anything  it is that bourgeois society can weather the death of God without collapsing into either passive or active nihilism.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  But for the purpose of this essay  it is of greatest importance to stress that Aphorism  only represents one aspect of Nietzsche  s conception of the European crisis  and by no means does it express the great complexities and ironies surrounding the death of God . Indeed  as Nietzsche begins Book V of  em  The Gay Science  em  with an apocalyptic vision  he follows it immediately with Aphorism  in which he stresses the longterm continuity of JudeoChristian culture . While  The Meaning of our Cheerfulness  images a  new dawn   Nietzsche juxtaposes it with an aphorism that reminds one of the presence of the past . Nietzsche approaches this recognition of the  em  long dur√©  em  of culture through a discourse on epistemology.  p    p  In Aphorism    How we  too  are still Pious   Nietzsche first observes that the  scientific spirit  of rational inquiry is one of testing and scrutinizing established convictions  for example   does a heavier body actually fall faster than a lighter one   Science is ultimately a process in which  convictions  are destroyed  those that crumble under scrutiny are discarded  and those that hold are no longer mere convictions but  knowledge  and  truth.  In describing this spirit  Nietzsche  no doubt  has in mind Descartes objective in his  em  Meditations on First Philosophy  em     to bring into question every single idea  perception  and premise in order to arrive at a firm ground for knowledge . This is certainly not anything that Nietzsche takes lightly  far from being an  irrationalist   Nietzsche views the breaking down of conviction as the heart of any great philosophy   p    p   G  reat spirits are skeptics . Zarathustra is a skeptic . Strength   em  freedom  em  which is born of the strength and overstrength of the spirit  proves itself by skepticism . Men of convictions are not worthy of the least consideration in fundamental questions of value and disvalue . Convictions are prisons   AC   .  p    p  But if science strives to knock down convictions  Nietzsche discerns a deeper  unspoken  em  conviction  em  undergirding the entire enterprise  it is one that is so pervasive and indispensable to science as a system that it can never be confronted directly   We see that science also rests on a faith   GS V    .  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  This conviction is that  truth has value.   p    p  The  value  of truth might seem selfevident  however  being that it is often the great liars and manipulators who come out on top  one should ask seriously   em  Why not deceive   em  Moreover   em  Why not allow oneself to be deceived   em  This is hardly facetious . Throughout his oeuvre  Nietzsche connects the acquisition of greater knowledge with  em  pain  em  .  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  Some knowledge might have pragmatic value  and certainly Nietzsche would see  wonder  and  curiosity  underlying the  will to truth   however  he views knowledge of the highest quality to be that which destroys the foundations of a culture and paralyzes an individual  s will to action . In his major treatise on historiography  Nietzsche associates knowledge with  the historical sense   that is  scholarly historicism and boldly concludes that ignorance  forgetfulness  and the denial history is of great value to a people or culture   p    p  No artist would ever paint a picture  no general would win a victory  no people would gain its freedom without first having longed for and struggled towards that end in such an  em  nhistorical  em  condition . Just as the man of action  in Goethe phrase  is always unscrupulous  so he is always ignorant too   HSDL   .  p    p  The man of profound knowledge might achieve a kind of power  but he is also prone to becoming a  Hamlet   a man nauseated by knowing and thinking too much  see BT   .  p    p  In Nietzsche  s mind   the value of truth  has a distinct origin  which I will discuss in the next section . Before this  it is useful to make some preliminary conclusions . Among these is the recognition that Nietzsche might not be as  postmodern  as is often thought . The idea that Nietzsche  s perspective on science is a refutation of truth and thus an assertion of  relativism  is doubtful . Zarathustra does not bring  relativism  to the world down from the mountaintop  but the terrible  em  truth  em  that God is dead . Any kind of defined systemwhether it be Science  Christianity  or Buddhismis based upon  in Walter Kaufmann  s words   a number of primary assumptions from which  one  draws a net of inferences and thus deduces  the  system  but  one  can not from within  the  system  establish the truth of his premises.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  Nietzsche attempts a bold new experiment in which he turns the  will to truth  against those most fundamental assumptionseven against itselfand tests whether the whole system might hold  or not.  p    p  In that the search for truth is only rarely practical and usually proves deleterious  it can only acquire meaning through a system of value outside itself . It is Nietzsche  s radical conclusion in Aphorism  that it is the JudeoChristian tradition that gave birth to the  will to truthat all costs.  In a characteristic dialectical flip  it is JudeoChristianity that birthed the sciences . It is in this way that Nietzsche ironically derives the title   How we  too  are still Pious    p    p   E  ven we seekers after knowledge today  we godless antimetaphysicians  still take our fire  too  from the flame lit by a faith that is thousands of years old  that Christian faith . . . that God is the truth  that truth is divine .  GS V     p    p  It is thus exactly that which is most harmed by the will to truth that brought it into the world.  p    p  How religion would become so audacious as to value truth is a complicated story  and one that emerges from Nietzsche  s view of history and the place of the Jews  Christians  and national politics in the ancient world.  p    p  Whatever Nietzsche eventually thought of the German nationstate  all of his texts evince a certain esteem  even nostalgia  for ancient  peoples   that is  historical races with their own culture and religion . As mentioned above  the Athenian  em  ethnos  em  was of central importance  but Nietzsche has similar reverence for other peoples of the ancient Mediterranean world and many across Europe and Asia . Nietzsche  s exact concept of a  people  is difficult to pin down . Obviously  the term is defined ethnically  and Nietzsche often uses  race  interchangeably with  people.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  However  for Nietzsche  a  people is far more than a mere biological entity . Although never made explicit  Nietzsche  s anthropology was greatly informed by a kind of  theory of the inheritance of acquired characteristics.  In the words of Menahem Brinker   A race is for him primarily a group of people united by their common lifeexperience which is interiorized and passed on from one generation to the next as cultural heritage and as inherited traits of character   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  .  National character  was forged over time.  p    p  Nietzsche  s concept of a people also had a prominent  em  theological  em  component   A people which still believes in itself retains its own god . In him it reveres the conditions which let it prevail  its virtuesit projects its pleasure in itself  its feeling of power onto a being to whom one may offer thanks   AC   . Under a national god  a people would construct a formal morality and system of values that was informed by the conditions for their wellbeing and position in the world . As Zarathuatra exclaims in his speech  Of Self Overcoming    What  a  people believe to be good and evil betrays to me an ancient will to power   Z II    . In the figure of the Hindu lawgiver Manuhis thought expressed in his law book   em  Manu Smriti  em   circa  B.C .  Nietzsche offers a concrete example of the legislatorcumchiefcumpriest who forges a great people . Manu  who became revered in Hinduism as the forefather of the entire human race  succeeded in Nietzsche  s mind by raising his people to kind of cultural and religious perfection . After a long era of fragmentation and chaos  Manu took the best that was achieved in this period of  experimentation  and codified a single  timeless religion and system of values . Nietzsche describes Manu  s culture as reaching an  automatism of instinct  in which values had become unconscious . He created a  second nature.   p    p  Just as  peoples  are at the center of Nietzsche  s concept of theology and value  so are they of great importance to his major discourses on epistemology . More specifically   a people  is directly connected in Nietzsche  s mind with his concept of the  will to truth  and the ways that this has manifested itself . Nietzsche  s most basic conclusion in this line is set down in  em  Zarathustra  em  in the aphorism  On the Famous Wise Men   Z II    . Here  it is the  famous philosophers  beloved by their communitieswho  in claiming to have reached  truth   have actually transformed the prejudices and superstitions of a people into dogma or philosophy . As he does throughout  em  Zarathustra  em   Nietzsche encapsulates this idea in a striking image  and in this case  it is one that is highly satirical  the  famous wise man  is an ass pulling a cart . The  cart   of course  represents  the people   who are grateful to their assphilosopher for his tireless efforts.  p    p  The sentiment that philosophers  or at least  famous  ones  are basically sophists and demagogues who  tell the people what they want to hear  is hardly new . However  this notion functions idiosyncratically within Nietzsche  s thought as a whole . Despite the obvious satire of the image  Nietzsche is not wholly opposed to  famous wise men.  As discussed above  Nietzsche has an irrepressible nostalgia for peoples who could write their  tables of good and evil  and were confident in themselves . For this   famous wise men  and their  truths  were indispensable . In many ways  Nietzsche views the decadence and cultural barrenness of Europe as expressed by their inability to invent a new theology . In reference to the  strong races of Northern Europe   Nietzsche laments that they never rejected the Christian God foisted upon them in the late Roman Empire  but instead allowed themselves to be defined by JudeoChristianity    a  lmost two thousand yearsand not a single new god    AC    .  p    p  National philosophers might have served their purpose  however  Nietzsche  s nostalgia has its limits  and he unequivocally rejects  national philosophy  as a worldview for Europe  s future . Nietzsche makes no effort to tell his age a quaint bedtime story or become Europe  s latest  or last   famous wise man.   p    p  Nietzsche  s sense that  national religions   at least within the confines of Europe  are both impossible and undesirable has much to do with his understanding of the JudeoChristian legacy . On one level  Christianity is for Nietzsche  just another religion   and it shares much in common with the national religions . In this case  it is an expression of the will to power of the downtrodden within the  em  imperium Romanum  em   and one can criticize it as such  as Nietzsche does at length in the  em  Genealogy  em   . But Nietzsche views this sociological insight as only of partial importance in assessing JudeoChristianity and its impact on Europe.  p    p  From the beginning  Nietzsche claims that Christianity was  at heart   em  never a national religion  em   and its dynamic was always expansive and supranational in character . In Nietzsche  s words  Christianity was  not a function of a raceit turned to every kind of man who was disinherited by life  it had its allies everywhere   AC   . From this broad base of support in the ancient world  the JudeoChristian legacy surfaced  in a variety of manifestations  and came to inform all peoples and classes of Europe  and beyond  . Christianity thus lacked completely other religions  basis in the sustenance of a distinct group  with its good and evil  high and low  sentiments and attachments.  p    p  But beyond this matter of scale  Nietzsche viewed Christianity as different in character from national religions . Much of this is expressed in the fact that Nietzsche views Christianity as possessing an epistemology radically different from the  national epistemologies  described above . More specifically  JudeoChristianity has a  will to truth  like no other . In Nietzsche  s mind  much of this results from Judaism  s place in the ancient world . In order to properly understand JudeoChristian epistemology  one must turn to the story of the Jews.  p    p  It is well known that Nietzsche was a fierce  em  anti  em  antiSemite . It was not particularly difficult for Nietzsche to take this position in the latter part of his career . AntiSemitism was indelibly linked in his mind with Wagner and the Bayreuth circle  his sister  s poor choice in husbands  and pompous German nationalismthat is to say  everything which Nietzsche found most distasteful and felt that he had to overcome in himself . Nietzsche  s hatred of antiSemitism culminated in his letter sent to Franz Overbeck  at the onset of madness in January of   announcing that he was  having all antiSemites shot.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  But then  being an antiantiSemite doesn  t quite mean that he was a philoSemite  nor does it quite tell us what Nietzsche thought of the Jews . Examined closely  Nietzsche  s depictions of Judaism and the Jews reveals that he was intensely ambivalent about botha certain antiSemitism and penchant for doubleedged compliments are combined with an enduring admiration . In his view  the Jews are  at the same time  a strong heroic people  a slaverace most responsible for the decline of aristocratic values  and potential  good Europeans.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup   p    p  Nietzsche unequivocally admires the Biblical Jewish people  and uses rapturous language to describe the  Homeric  world of the Pentateuch   great human beings  a heroic landscape  and something of the very rarest quality in the world  the incomparable na√Øvet√© of the  em  strong heart  em   what is more I find a people   GM III    . At this point in time  Judaism was a healthy and powerful national religion . Being that Jews and their political order were  in the right  that is  natural relationship to all things   they were able to create their own table of good and evil and invent a God that expressed their strength  Yahweh in his original form  was the expression of a consciousness of power  of joy in oneself  of hope for oneself  through him victory and welfare were expected   AC    .  p    p  But as the Jews began to experience defeat and subserviencerecast in historical terminology  in the period following the destruction of the First Temple  th Century B.C .  Yahweh began to lose his luster . In a striking admonishment  Nietzsche claims   they should have let him go   AC   . That is  once Yahweh ceased to be a god of power and victory  the Jews should have been creative enough to make a new one . This was  of course  common practice throughout the Roman Empire  as gods were ordered  created  and destroyed within the federalist Pantheon.  p    p  Instead  Jewish political life began to be dominated by a priestly class  and Yahweh was reimagined . If the Jews could not experience power in the real world  they claimed that  the good  was not found there but only in a new  higher  realm of morality . The god of the Jews became  in turn  an abstract demand  an  evileye   a  morality.  The situation was made worse by the fact that the priestly class transformed the Jewish historical consciousness  empowering themselves and devaluing the Biblical age of heroes which Nietzsche so admired   p    p   I  n the hands of the Jewish priests  the great age in the history of Israel became an age of decay  the Exile  the long misfortune  was transformed in to an eternal punishment for the great agean age in which the priest was still a nobody   AC   .  p    p  Judaism was further affected by the Jews  conflicts with the Roman Empire  culminating in the destruction of the Second Temple  st Century  B.C.  . It is  indeed  this confrontation through which Nietzsche generates one of his most characteristic opposition   Rome against Judea  Judea against Rome  Rome felt the Jews to be something like antinature itself  its antipodal monstrosity as it were  in Rome the Jew stood  em  convicted  em  of hatred for the whole human race   GM I    .  Judea against Rome  is the depiction not of too rival nations and national religions but of two completely opposed  em  Weltanschauungen  em  and moral systems  on one side  there is the aristocratic masterclass  conscious of its own power  and able to subordinate and integrate rival nations into a stable  productive hierarchy  on other  there is a small  wretched tribe of people claiming no national power  as they had none   but then making a grasp for universal dominion.  p    p  In Nietzsche  s reading  the Jews are  the most  em  catastrophic  em  people in world history   AC    but not merely because they created a religion of  em  ressentiment  em  directed against the aristocratic Romans . For as a religion of a weak people  Judaism would hardly be unusual in this respect and would never have gained worldhistorical significance . The Jews were truly catastrophic in that they transformed the nature of religion itself.  p    p  In order to understand the new metaphysics created in Judaism  it is useful to turn to Nietzsche  s description of the formation of the conscience and the sense of guilt . Drawing on the fact that the German word   em  Schuld  em   refers to both  debt   in the monetary sense  and  guilt   in the moral sense   Nietzsche claims that  in the prehistory of mankind  the moral conscience emerged as an internalization of the punishment one received for failing to repay loans . The feeling of guilt is a means for man to punish himself by reproducing the fear and loathing of indebtedness in other contexts . Obviously  this had a classdimension  for it is primarily the lower orders and weaker nations who experienced chronic indebtedness  and thus were more likely to develop the internalization . The Jews underwent an intensification of this process in that not only were they constantly in a position of subservience  em  vis√†vis  em   master  nations  but their culture became dominated by a priestly class that eagerly transformed  guiltdebt  into a exaltation of their weak and downtrodden state  the  ascetic ideal.   p    p  Nietzsche relates that  as this process ensued  this painful internalization of guilt became simply too great for the slave to bear  and he and his society sought a means of discharging it . This could take many forms  Nietzsche views the primary one as entailing a grand reversal  a projection back of the feeling of debt onto the  creditor   that is  the master . The Jews thus formed an entire metaphysics based upon  em  ressentiment  em  . The  transvaluation of all values  that is  the valuing of the weak  shameful slaves as  good  and the powerful  conscienceless rulers as  evil  operated through this process in the latter days of the ancient world.  p    p  This great  reversal of guilt   so to speak  is directly related to the Jews  development of monotheism and a universal religion . In Nietzsche  reading of history  it is the Jews and the original Christian slaveclasses throughout the Empire that achieved the  maximum feeling of guilty indebtedness   em  des Schuldgef√ºhl  em   on earth.  Nietzsche views this as expressed by a universalist theory and  the maximum god attained thus far   GM II     the one  true godYahweh . Not only did the Jews and Christians divorce their god from the attainment of worldly power  but in imagining a higher realm  they grasped at a kind of grand  em  coup d  √©tat  em  . The refashioned Yahweh was above the gods of Rome and all other deities  indeed  he superseded them . The Jews were the inventors of what Nietzsche calls  the grand style in morality   BGE VIII    . In this way  Nietzsche imagines a great clash of universal religions  on the one hand  JudeoChristian monotheism  and on the other  the Imperium Romanum and its Pantheon.  p    p  In the struggle of  Rome against Judea   Judea won . Nietzsche views this as happening mostly on a psychological level  put simply  the allencompassing Judaic  and later JudeoChristian  system entrapped the nobles and made them feel guilty about themselves  about their power  beauty  and dominance . Beyond the Roman aristocrats  Nietzsche sees the preJudeoChristian world as replete with a host of figures who   imbued with faith in their own perfection  went about with the dignity of a great matador   these were the great masters who had confidence in their ability to achieve power and  it should be mentioned  were unafraid to be cruel .  Moral Skepticism  that is  the  evil eye  and the unflagging criticism of the JudeoChristian systemsucceeded in drawing into question all of the noble man  s great strengthspride  ruthlessness  ambitionand in  accusing and embittering him  to the point that he lost faith in himself  GS III    .  p    p  Nietzsche views this great  loss of nerve  as lamentable  for there is little doubt that he felt the great  cruel masterclass to be the foundation of high culture in the ancient world . This being said  Nietzsche recognizes that the  transvaluation of all values  is at the heart of the sciences and the modern systems of knowledge . Indeed  Nietzsche views Judaism and Christianity as the first religions to fully systematize the potential of doubt and skepticism . The ancient Jew and Christian might originally pursue  truth  out of  em  ressentiment  em   in the sense of  bringing the great down to size  or  looking up the skirt  of the Queen . But this is transformed into a call for knowledge for its own sake . As Nietzsche points out  it is no coincidence that the great philosophers have been social outcastsHeraclitus  Socrates  Epicurius  Nietzsche  BGE I    .  em  Ressentiment  em  is the secret  guilty origin of philosophy . Moreover  with the expansion to universalism  the acquisition of knowledge becomes a duty  a painful binding of the self to achieve knowledge  for its own sake  and  at all costs.   p    p  Furthermore  it is with man  s  turning against himself  that it becomes possible to enact a great transformation of values . In this line  it is the dynamic of JudeoChristian  em  ressentiment  em  that gives substance to Nietzsche  s metaphor  quoted above  of the  taut bow.   Turned against himself   JudeoChristian man is a strange  seemingly  unnatural   being  but as such he begins to view himself no longer as an end but as a stage in a grand transformation   p    p   T  he existence on earth of an animal soul turned against itself . . . was something so new  profound  unheard of  enigmatic  contradictory   em  and pregnant with a future  em  that the aspect of the earth was essentially altered . . . .  M  an . . . gives rise to an interest  a tension  a hope  almost a certainty  as if with him something were announcing and preparing itself  as if man were not a goal but only a way  an episode  a bridge  a great promise.  GM II     p    p  In describing the development of the systems of knowledge  Nietzsche returns to the image of the  taut bow  and  great politics.  Judaism gave birth not only to the universalism and value of truth that characterize European societies  but also to the capacity to transfigure radically these values.  p    p  As explored in the following section  this aspect of JudeoChristian legacy is of particular importance in informing Nietzsche  s discussions of thcentury European politics and his hope for supranational integration.  p    p  Publishing in the latter third of the th century  Nietzsche couldn  t help but comment on the most important political development of his timenationalism . In his mature period  Nietzsche  s stance towards the nationstate was almost uniformly hostile .  This might come as a surprise to those who associate him with German National Socialism .  In these discussions  Nietzsche is not interested in sovereignty or the state in themselves so much as their modern  republican  and  nationaldemocratic  variations . In this line  the central political problem for Nietzsche is one of  em  representation  em  . Nietzsche  or Zarathustra to be exact  claims that the state exists through a central lie   I  the state  am the people.  It is this equation and promise of representation that  after the collapse of  divine right  and absolutism  became the fundamental source of legitimacy.  p    p  Whereas healthy peoples are able to write their own tablets of good and evil  Zarathustra calls the modern state  the death of peoples  and  in an ironic reference to Hobbes  Leviathan    the coldest of all cold monsters   Z I    . While a great legislator like Manu was a  creator  he brought order to his culturethe modern state is an  annihilator.  It simply  takes   its managers exist by taxing those below them . And it is a  em  cold  em  monster in that it  bask  s  in the sunshine  of the allegiance and men of actual achievement . And  to Zarathustra  s dismay  it has seduced the  great souls  of every nation . Here  Nietzsche certainly has in mind a figure like Wagner  after the events of  he was a nomadic artist who radically rethought the operatic form  by  and the establishment of the Bayreuth festival  he was  nationalized  and thus became  respectable  and  palatable.   p    p  Keeping in mind Nietzsche  s esteem and nostalgia for the age of peoples  it is important to note that his critique of the modern state functions around a nationstate opposition . As mentioned above  Nietzsche  s mature work is filled with barbs against all things German  however  the moments in which he criticizes the German state are exactly those in which he allows himself to recognize the cultural achievement of the German peopleeven if he does this in the form of his signature doubleedged complements.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  While in other works Nietzsche depicts Germans as lugubrious beerguzzlers   em  vis√†vis  em  their state  they are a people of ponderous depths  fixatedperhaps to a faulton a vision of the future  BGE VIII    . Germans famously have an identity crisis  It is characteristic of the Germans that the question   what is German   never dies out amongst them   BGE VIII    but then this makes them philosophical . In light of Nietzsche  s political ideal of the good European  it is certainly significant here that he depicts the German soul as disposed to  cosmopolitanism   BGE VIII    . In  years after the founding of the Reichhe exclaimed    German spirit   for the past eighteen years a contradiction in terms   TI I    . In a clear reference to the leader of the new Germany  Otto von Bismarck  Nietzsche speaks of  a statesman  who convinced the Germans to sacrifice their great virtues for the sake of a  novel and dubious mediocrity   BGE VIII    . Bismarck was able to seduce the Germans through  in Nietzsche  s exact words   Great Politics.  Far from being the merger of politics and the war of spirits that Nietzsche foresaw in  em  Ecce Homo  em   EC IV     Bismarck  s  great politics  is little more than pomp and circumstance  a parody of actual greatness . The great chancellor  piles up for  the Germans  another tower of Babel  a monster of empire and power   and willing citizens  grovel on their bellies before anything massive   BGE VIII    . Nietzsche holds his nose at this spectacle and refers to the process as the  spiritual flattening  of a people . In becoming citizens of the Reich  Germans forgo their spiritual boundlessness and learn  politicking.   p    p  Like most critics of nationalism  Nietzsche is quick to place national formation within a particular historical context and deconstruct any claims the nationstate might have of being an organic outgrowth out of an ancient community . Far from representing an eternal  em  Deutsch  em   Nietzsche views the Reich as a part of a Europeanwide spirit of secular republicanism . And despite Kaiser Wilhelm  s claims of divine sovereignty  he views the Reich as part of  Europe  s  em  democratic  em  movement   BGE VIII    . In this line  Nietzsche generally criticizes the nationstate in much the same way that he criticizes the Enlightenment  s political offspring  democracy and liberalism . Democratic and republican politics seek to oppress the great individual exemplars of the human species and mark the lowering of tastes to suit the herd . Nietzsche takes this point very far  even speculating that democratization was actually a   em  physiological  em  process  in which Europeans were quite literally getting flatter and flatter and more and more boring . Europeans are no longer a collection of peoples  but a homogenous mass.  p    p  This being said  Nietzsche is not merely an aristocratic conservative  lamenting the dumbingdown of tastes  though he certainly did lament the dumbingdown of tastes  . Just as with the discussion of  shadows over Europe   Nietzsche views this  massification  of peoples as inevitable and irreversible  indeed  he attempts to glimpse a potential transformation taking place  em  through  em   not against  the  democratic movement.  Indeed  Nietzsche provocatively imagines that the great leveling will eventuate in a  result which would seem to be least expected by those who naively praise  the process of democratization   the apostles of  modern ideas.   For the new  democratic man  in the form of either the  last man  described in  em  Zarathustra  em   Z I  P    or the  garrulous worker  in  em  Beyond Good and Evil  em   BGE VIII    shall be  in status if not name  a slave . Slaves  of course  need Masters  much like cattle need cowboys . And this means that  in exceptional cases the  em  strong  em  human being will have to turn out stronger and richer than perhaps ever before.  The democratization of Europeans will be the opportunity for the  cultivation of  em  tyrants  em  .   p    p  In the wake of thcentury totalitarianisms  Nietzsche  s call for the cultivation of tyrants is undoubtedly unwelcome . As Jacob Golomb and Robert Wistrich observe  Nietzsche is not a protoFascist or Nazi  but he is most definitely a kind of  godfather  of these movements . In their words  he was a  prophet of the spiritual vacuum that gave birth to the totalitarian abysses of the twentieth century . As such he remains profoundly relevant to our time.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  But then  perhaps one could push Nietzsche  s  totalitarian  connection much further than Golomb and Wistrich would like . Both Hitler and Stalin might even seem to be an excellent candidate for the  artist tyrant  in that both sustained their dictatorship by replacing politics with the spectacle of power . Nietzsche  of course  never discusses things like a  onepartystate  or the  F√ºhrer principle   however  in his unpublished writings  which were collected as  em  The Will to Power  em      he did specifically speak of  international racial unions whose task will be to rear a  em  master  em  race   WP   . Furthermore  in stressing the need for fearless new conquerors  he rhetorically asks   Where are the barbarians of the twentieth century    WP   .  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup   p    p  Nietzsche never published any statements like this in his lifetime  and it is irresponsible to treat them uncritically as definitive components of his philosophy . Nevertheless  the questions that such a statement evoke are serious and invariably color any reading of Nietzsche  s political philosophy . Without doubt there is a certain racial  eugenicist component to Nietzsche  s vision of the new Europe  however  it is of vital importance to look very closely at exactly how Nietzsche depicts his projected tyrants and masters of Europe . Nietzsche might be notorious for writing positively about the  blond beast  and the  noble races   GM I      sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  but ultimately both of these figures are part of Nietzsche  s vision of  prehistory   of the halfforgotten memory of man . They are not the Masters of Europe  who will arise after the death of God.  p    p  Nietzsche ultimately never details who the Overman   em  √úbermensch  em   is  much as Marx remained poetic and elliptical when he described communism . That said  he offers glimpses . . .  p    p  It is useful to begin this discussion with the figure of the  good European.  Nietzsche is most explicit about what he means by this term when he discuses the role of the Jews in modern European society . Nietzsche  s portrait of the Jewish people is  in many ways  familiar  he writes of them as wandering without a home  still alienated from the European national communities even after the widespread liberal reforms improving their treatment . Their alien status has certain benefits  however  for in being excluded from national life  the Ashkenazim maintain their own distinct cultural traditions and remain  in Nietzsche  s words  a people   em  aere perennius  em    more enduring than bronze.  p    p  With this in mind  Daniel Conway has suggested that the European Jews stand for Nietzsche as a kind of political alternative  a living critique of his grand vision of a renewed Roman Empire   Despite his bold  Europhilic swagger  he feared that  em  they  em   the Jews  may have succeeded in formulating the optimal strategy for promoting cultural advancement in late modernity.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  This claim is highly useful in that it is  in my view  a misreading of Nietzsche  s position towards the Ashkenazim  but then it brings to the fore an important point . It is certainly true that Nietzsche saw the value in being the outsider  all great philosophers are outsiders  including Nietzsche himself . Furthermore  Zarathustra speaks directly to the lonely and disposed in his call for the creation of a new spiritual order   You that are lonely today  you that are withdrawing  you shall one day be the people  out of you  who have chosen yourselves  there shall grow a chosen peopleand out of them the overman   Z I    . It might seem that here Nietzsche is calling for a kind of  Jewish  good European  the Good European as a wandering nomad . Those who have  chosen themselves  will form an ironic  chosen people.   p    p  Nietzsche undoubtedly desires to empower those who stand against the modern world  however  in this scheme  they are not to remain  free spirits  for long . In the above quotation  Nietzsche does not imagine the alienated as forever standing apart  but as ultimately triumphing  as giving birth to a higher stage of humanity  and thus laying the foundations for rule . Similarly  what Nietzsche admires in the Jews   optimal strategy  is not their apartness in itself  but their potential to achieve  mastery over Europe   BGE VIII    . Indeed  Nietzsche scolds the Jews for trying to assimilate into national cultures . Were these indestructible  nomadic people not capable of much more  for better and for worse  In making such claims  Nietzsche does not reveal himself to be a kind of  Jewish supremacist   so to speak . The Jew  who has survived persecution and attempted annihilationsurvived even national assimilation and who has built international networksare an image  at least in part  of what a  Good European  might be.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  But the Ashkenazim  s international culture and  morality in the grand style   which has been developed into a variety of ethical philosophies  make them particularly well suited for the governance of the continent.  p    p  In no better way does Nietzsche express that his political project amounts to a  transvaluation of all values   for it is the wanderers and nomads who were  as physical types  those to whom Christianity would most likely appeal in the ancient world  and furthermore  those who would most likely succeed in crafting a religion of  em  ressentiment  em  against the nobility . The lonely and dispossessed are poised to become a new master class.  p    p  Immediately following his paean to the  em  imperium Romanum  em  quoted at the beginning of this essay  Nietzsche offers a glimpse of his ideal of the man who might sit on the throne . His language here is grandiose and deserves to be quoted at length   p    p  I envisage a  em  possibility  em  of a perfect supraterrestrial magic and fascination of color  it seems to me that it glistens in all the tremors of subtle beauty  that an art is at work in it  so divine  so devilishly divine that one searches millennia in vain for a second such possibility     em  Cesare Borgia as pope  em  . Am I understood   AC    p    p  The imagery is meant to shock  and Nietzsche  s effusiveness expresses his glee in blasphemy . But then Nietzsche intends   em  Cesare Borgia as pope  em   to be taken seriously  and such an image connects to many components of his wider political thought . In installing Borgia in Rome  Nietzsche means to attack the JudeoChristian tradition  in the decisive place  in the very seat of Christianity  placing the  em  noble  em  values on the throne   going further  he seeks to bring these values  right into the instincts  into the lowest needs and desires of those who sat there   AC   . A polemical or merely blasphemous opposition to Christianityin which case he would image a  sultan in Babylon  or the likeis nowhere to be seen . To the contrary  Nietzsche seeks to reconstitute the entire JudeoChristian legacy . The  instincts  and  lowest needs and desires  of the Jew or Christian are transformed into the foundation for a new aristocratic order . Just as the  good European  marks a kind of reversal of the tradition of Jewish  em  ressentiment  em   so Nietzsche imagines the coming tyrants as an upside down version of the greatest of all priestly classes.  p    p  Bergman  Peter .  .  em  Nietzsche   the Last Antipolitical German.   em  Bloomington  IN  Indiana University Press.  p    p  Brinker  Menahem .  .

Growing up in the  s and  s  I was inured to the multicultural calendar of ethnic holidays I didn  t resonate with or understand . But no one ever expected me to actually celebrate Rosh Hashanahor wear Tshirts that read  I  ve got a little Jewish in me  or pinch anyone not donning a yarmulke . At one point  I started  a href  http  en.wikipedia.orgwikiOrangeOrder   wearing Orange  a  on March  . . . though the message was seemingly lost on most everyone I encountered.  p    p  Much like Halloween  St. Patrick  s Day has emerged as an excuse to get dressed up  get drunk  and get laid . The same goes for the German festival of Oktoberfest  which is growing in popularity . But Ocktoberfest retains a connection to authenticity and tradition  which I find totally absent in the spring festival of idiots wearing Guinness novelty top hats and obnoxious women screaming while making group selfies.  p    p  We moderns  who are living out the End of History  think that cultural festivals are something for those  em  other  em  peoples . The Day of the Dead  the Thai Pongal  and Carnival are for those who haven  t quite entered modernity  who lack our selfconsciousness  rootlessness  and irony . In this way  we don  t consider St. Patrick  s Day to be a real holiday at all . But truly  what we celebrate and how we celebrate it reveals who we are  and the shared assumptions amongst Americans of many races.  p    p  In  em  The Good Shepard  em      Robert De Niro  s flawed but fascinating drama about the origins of the CIA  there is a quotable exchange that might be a fitting epigraph for the tombstone of the AngloSaxon Protestant elite .

What about you people  Mr. Wilson  what do you have   p    p   strong  Edward Wilson  strong   The United States of America . The rest of you are just visiting.  p    p  It  s all too easy to read that last line as an expression of arrogant WASP supremacismor as Hollywood  s smear of the nowdefunct American eliteand overlook its tragic dimension.  p    p  Edward Wilson is equal parts  company man   dutiful  anonymous upperlevel manager  and patriotic samurai . He has dedicated himself totally to his agency and to the Cold War  which was imagined as a titanic  allornothing battle for the world . At the end of his life  Wilson is so estranged from his wife and son  he barely seems to know them  his only passion appears to be building model boats in bottles.  p    p  Wilson here is an intense example of a general tendency among WASPs to dissolve their ethnic and racial identity into a corporate entity  the United States of America . Wilson is America . . . and isn  t at the same time . The USA is the vehicle for WASP power and identity  but its real essence is that of a mass  managerial bureaucracy and geopolitical administrator . Ultimately  Wilson and his class were also  just visiting   they were just one more people to occupy the U.S.A.  s upperlevels management positions  and were easily replaced by Liebowitzs  Chens  and even O  Reillys.  p    p  St . Patrick  s Day is the celebration of the Underdognot only the Irish themselves but the perennial  mythic Underdog that is always  just visiting  the United States . What is characteristic about the U.S. is that there is no celebration of the Overdog . There is no St. George  s Day festival  memorializing the people that defined America . In this way  America has no culture .

Part of the problem is there is a dearth of good information  and a bounty of superficial  politically selfserving garbage . But the real problem is misplaced emphasis . Western experts and commenters are used to thinking of history in Hegelian termsas the story of human progress . The model might be a good fit for EuroAmerican history  it is at least workable . But the progressive model falls apart when applied to the history of Islam . Islam  s heights seem to correspond to the West  s depths  and viceversa . The  Progress  model causes Westerners to ask the wrong questions about Islamic history .  What went wrong    Why has the Middle East been so beset by violence    When will Islam adopt modern political and ethical principles    span   p    p   span style  fontweight      This misguided criticism has two facesliberal and reactionary . Both sides share the Hegelian view of historythat millennialong  worldwide advance of the human spirit . But each side approaches its subject with different motives . Liberals  who dominate public discourse on the subject  surprise   assume the intrinsic goodness of all people .  Islam is peace   eye roll  . They feel good when they can cite examples of seemingly precocious modernism  such as early Muslim rulers  tolerance  in the strictest sense  for religious minorities . It makes them feel good to contrast these anecdotes with the supposedly unrelenting fanaticism of EuroAmericans throughout the Middle Ages and the Early Modern period  the th and th centuries  up to and including last week . This rosy  Islamophilic picture is not really about Islam . It is just another stick with which to beat guilt into the EuroAmerican historical conscience.  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      The liberal position  while dominant  does not go unchallenged . On the other side are the reactionaries . They are  reactionaries  because they have no real position on Islam  they only know that the liberals are wrong  and reflexively counterattack . Theirs is a form of hypercriticism  given to denying longestablished facts and trends of Islamic history with little or no justification other than to refute the Islamophiles . Given the current situation in the West  their excesses are understandable . But the reactionaries  zeal leads them to stake out indefensible positions . Many of them are have ulterior motivessome are proJewish fanatics or apologists for imperialism  others are democratic ideologues . But they share a defect . They lack a healthy  Faustian drive to pursue universal Truthwhether we like its conclusions or not.  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      Both approaches fail for two reasons . First  neither affords its subject the proper attitude of  sympathetic criticism.  The student must devote himself to understanding a culture on its own termslearning its languages  reading its history and literatureall the while imagining things from its perspective . Once he has done this  he can render judgement on its ethics  its cultural attainments  and its overall importance to history . This was the approach of the great orientalists of the late th and early th century . They devoted tremendous intellectual effort to comprehending Islamic civilization  yet they were unafraid to pass judgement on its shortcomings . The liberals have no aptitude for criticism  the reactionaries have none for sympathy.  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      Second  the liberals and reactionaries neglect the questions of philosophical history . It is from this oversight that they fall into their assumption of perpetual historical progress . But there is a better way . One hundred years ago  Oswald Spengler reframed the discussion of history by tearing down idea of progress  at least as it is commonly understood  . His  Copernican revolution  in historical thought worked wonders for the study of Classical civilization and Europe  but it would prove even more effective for understanding the meaning of Middle Eastern history . Spengler shifted the emphasis away from time and toward Cultures . Following Spengler  we can understand how meaningless most of the questions posed by conventional commenters are  and begin to see Islam for what it really is.  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      Spengler rejected the conventional historical focus on religions and polities . He saw these as merely superficial expressions of something deeperthe Culture . Cultures  in Spengler  s scheme  are a complex of peoples who share a worldoutlook . This outlookthe spirit of a Culturedrives it to produce or adapt a religion .  Religion  is the outward expression of the worldoutlook and includes such things as prayer rituals  religious architecture  calligraphy and sculpture . For example  while EuroAmericans and Korean evangelicals may both be  Christians   they do not belong to the same Culture  because their worldoutlooks differ so drastically  despite their notionally common religion . A presentday American protestant has more in common  spiritually  with a thcentury Norse pagan than with a modernday Korean convert  despite professing the same doctrines . Cultures are the basic unit by which to analyze history.  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      Islam is part of the  Magian  Culture . In his  span   i   span style  fontweight      Decline of the West  span   i   span style  fontweight       Spengler defines the Magian Culture as comprising the Muslim Arabs  but also many preIslamic Middle Eastern groups such as the Babylonian Jews  the Zoroastrians  the Coptic and Syriac Christians  as well as syncreticheretical gnostic groups like the Manichaeans . It arose around the time of Christ and lasted till the th century  when the antirationalist thinker AlGhazali dealt the deathblow to Magian philosophical speculation . All of subsequent Magian history was  in Spengler  s view   civilization  grandiose  bombastic  imperial  but sterile . No new philosophical or religious ideas could arise from the Magian world outlook . It had run its course.  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      So the birth of Islam does not represent the foundation of a new religion . It was  rather  a revolution in Magian religious thought . As such  it is analogous to the Reformation in Western history . Like Luther  Muhammad preached a puritanical systematization of earlier currents in the spiritual thought of his Culture . Muhammad and Luther were both anticlerical  iconoclastic reformers who exhorted their adherents to build a more personal relationship with God . They both made the scripture accessible to the massesLuther by translating the bible into the vernacular  Muhammad by  receiving revelations  in easily memorized rhymed prose . After their deaths  their Cultures were unified the culture by marginalizing the earlier creeds and  at the same time  quickly spawning an array of heresies . The puritanical movements unleashed a storm  driving the postreformation Europeans and postIslam Magians to conquer half the world in a fanatical outburst of religious fervorcompare that to the religious and colonial wars of Europe in the th and th centuries .  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      Both movements  to a large degree  cleansed their cultures of foreign influence . Hellenistic influence on the Middle East  while not wiped out  was severely reduced in the first centuries of Islam . The Greek language  long the lingua franca of the Eastern Mediterranean  died out in Egypt and Syria  and later in Anatolia . To use Spengler  s term  Islam ended the hellenistic pseudomorphosis  falsedevelopment  of early Magian Culture  allowing it to come into its own . Likewise Luther and his successors purged Northern Europe of the illfitting GrecoRoman influence imposed by the Catholic Church . More and more  the European cultural initiative drifted northward . The centers of art migrated from Florence and Rome to Nuremberg  Rotterdam and Weimar . The Italian composers of the baroque were  by degrees  superseded by the likes of Bach and Handel . Thus Muhammad is not an Islamic Jesus  but a Luther . His movement  Islam  is a puritanical systematization of earlier currents in the Magian spirit .  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      All this flies in the face of the conventional wisdom . Lacking any deeper insight into the place of Islam in history  the MassMedia has been promoting a meme   Islam needs a Reformation  eg   a href  http  www.wsj.comarticlesareformationforislam   WSJ  a  .   span   span style  fontweight       a href  http  www.huffingtonpost.comrazarumiislamneedsreformationfb.htm   HuffPo  a  .  span   span style  fontweight       . It makes sense superficially . Based on the conventional historical assumptions  one would compare Muhammad to Jesus as founders of worldreligions . It follows then that Islam  having gotten a late start  is due for a reformation . After all  it  s been  centuries since Muhammad fled to Medina  and about the same duration separates Jesus from Martin Luther . The preReformation Church superficially resembles currentday Islam .  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      But with a deeper understanding of history  comparing Jesus to Muhammad is preposterous . In contrasting the current state of the West and the Middle East  it would be ridiculous to set the two up as analogues . Jesus no longer matters to Faustian man . When the decadent West looks for myths and heroes  it looks for worlddenying saints of Tolerance and Progress .

The fact that National Football League games followed  or replaced  Christian services lent them a certain  em  religious  em  quality . To oppose football would have been  for millions of Americans  the equivalent of denouncing dear old mom . For me  growing up in Texas in the s and  s  playing varsity football was nothing less than a rite of passage into manhood.  p    p  But over the past decade  football  s  untouchable  status has withered . Much of this has to do with highprofile cases of domestic violence . But more than anything  awareness of the impact of concussions and CTE is driving a silent boycott of the sport . Football is collapsing from the bottom up  as suburban parents pull their sons out of peewee leagues and encourage them to take up water polo or crosscountry . As scientists continue to learn more about the impact of repeated trauma to the brain  especially in early life  an ever greater number of people will find the sport taboo and unwatchable on a professional level .  The NFL has already reached a   million dollar settlement with former players over concussionrelated injuries and illnesses . No doubt  trial lawyers are salivating over the chance to plunder the industry for all its worth .   p    p  But ultimately  the concussion phenomenon is not a good reason to stop watching football . They  re grown men  after all  and the impulse to risk one  s health for fame and glory is admirable . Yes  football is dangerous  but the real reason we must stop watching football is that the sport is making us  em  less  em  dangerous   em  less  em  vital in critically important ways . Football fandom is domesticating White people . It  s turning us into meatsacks without agency . We are passive spectators  not just of sports but of history . There is a pressing need for us to unplug ourselves from the football machineto become atheists of the pigskin religionand dispel the mesmerizing quality it has over us minds.  p    p  A common refrain from many  conservative  football fans and commentators is that we should focus on  what happens on the field   and put race and politics aside . To the contrary . We must look at the impact this industry has  em  off the field  em   on politics  culture  society  sex  and raceon our morality  values  and hopes and dreams . We must look at how football makes us act and think.  p    p  In my lifetime  football has gone from being an cultural idol to yet one more American institution suffering from legitimacy crisisand with no obvious path to redemption . There is no better time to sound it out  to discover what  s hallow and what is resonate  what  s salvagble and what must be discarded.  p    p  On September     Donald Trump launched a new front in the culture war . More accurately  he revealed a racial and political animus that was simmering under the surface of professional sports for decades .

Trump was quick to claim that his opposition was  not about race  and only about  disrespecting the flag.  But for everyone participating in the protest  it was  em  all about race  em   and not just about police violence  . In the  a href  http  www.nfl.comnewsstoryaparticlecolinkaepernickexplainswhyhesatduringnationalanthem   words of Kaepernick  a    p    p  I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.  p    p  By   Kaepernick was no longer in the League . His performance had noticeably declined  and his theatrics apparently rendered him unsignable . But his absence only intensified the controversy  making him a kind of martyr of the racist system he protested.  p    p  Sportswriters  who tend to be soft liberals  have long cheered on the politicization of sports . It lends a  seriousness  to an otherwise of juvenile profession composed of nerds writing about jocks . It  s also a way of addressing the troubling dynamics of an overwhelmingly White audience cheering on overwhelmingly Black athletes  which I  ll discuss further below  .  p    p  The Anthem protestand the reaction to itwas yet another instance in the long saga once known as  The Negro Question  the political and social status of Africans living in a White country  slave or citizen  American or something else . To be fair  AfricanAmericans have to honestly ask themselves  Can we take part in the pageantry of a country that has never really been ours  and which  until very recently  maintained our social and political inferiority  Is assimilation possible  If so  is it desirable  And if not  then what   p    p  Kaepernick himself was particularly ambivalent about this question . He is of mixed race  with an absent Black father and a White mother who put him up for adoption . He was raised in Wisconsin by an apparently loving and nonracist White family . But assimilation and the warm embrace create anxiety  and Kaepernick is clearly in search of the authenticity  the  creed  of really being Black . In   he also sported an Afro.  p    p  On the other side  White fans perceive race  correctly  as a weapon used against them in all aspects of life  affirmative action  the  diversity  racket  White Guilt  White Privilege  etc . They thus seek  always unsuccessfully  to neutralize the subject with the promise of multiracial American patriotism or silly euphemisms like  We don  t  em  see  em  race.  The teamwork and  em  esprit de corps  em  offers the promise to Whites of one institutions where race really won  t matter . Trump  s demand that those spoiled athletes just shut up and be patriotic was a kind of last stand of this implicit White identity.  p    p  Trump certainly didn  t seek to destroy the NFL when he yelled  You  re fired   in Alabama . To the contrary  he sought to save football from itself . But the effect was something altogether different . White fans were already deeply  unconsciously troubled by the racial dynamic of the NFL . In fighting back  Trump revealed what was at stake . Fans saw the game with new eyes and found it unwatchable.  p    p  According to polling  NFL  s  a href  https  www.forbes.comsitesmikeozanianthenflsthreemostimportantmoneyindicatorsarepointingdown  bbeae   favorability rating dropped  a  from  percent to  percent  from  to  percent among males .

American Whites  or those from the declining middle class  spend the majority of their lives working jobs they don  t like simply to earn enough money to move away from dangerous  nonWhite neighborhoods where it is impossible to raise a family . They live their lives in recognition of racial reality  and then spend their luxury time retreating into racial fantasy . The stereotypical overweight and drunken fan is essentially outsourcing his identity and his fantasy life to Black athletes .  The film  a href  https  www.countercurrents.combigfan    em  Big Fan  em   a   starring Patton Oswalt  was probably the most compelling and terrifying portrayal of this phenomenon .  .  p    p  And the fan does this  paradoxically  from a position of superiority . After all  he  s the one paying money for athletes to entertain him . And while a select few players garner fame  wealth  and women  the vast majority will be left with broken bodies and the indifference of the masses . It  s a pattern as old as the Roman Coliseum  but the racial disparity between fan and playerenveloped in a national ideology of racial egalitarianismgives it a new dynamic.  p    p  The more thoughtful sportswriters have often  a href  https  www.amazon.comFortyMillionDollarSlavesRedemptiondp   suggested  a  something inherently exploitative about the fanplayer relationshipand  to a great extent  they  re right . Robert E. Lee observed that slavery degrades both master and slave  in turn  fandom degrades both player and fan . The Black player sees himself as a kind of performing monkey  a highpaid slave who puts his body and ego on the line for overweight White fans who will call him abusive names if he drops a pass or blows a coverage  that is  if he makes the kinds of mistakes everyone makes everyday  .  p    p  The fan simultaneously dehumanizes and idealizes the Black athlete . On the one hand  the athlete is a beast of burden  a commodity to be traded  wagered on  feted or laughed at depending on the situation .  By the time they  re sophomores in highschool  Black athletes have been scrutinized and quantified down to their yarddash time and hand size on recruiting Websites like  a href  https  rivals.com   Rivals.com  a  .  On the other hand  the fan views the athlete as a hero and unreachable pinnacle of masculinity  as something more than a man.  p    p  This kind of ambivalence is volatile . And as seen by some ugly confrontations on the field  just beneath the mutual admiration between players and fans is an intense contempt . The White fans who pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars on the tickets or merchandise to honor their favorite players would lock their doors if they saw them walking on the street . They would never allow a cornrowed Black athlete into their homes  except in the form of a commemorative oil painting.  p    p   img alt   class  alignnone wpimage sizefull  height    sizes   maxwidth  px  vw  px  src  wpcontentuploadsRGart.jpg  srcset  wpcontentuploadsRGart.jpg w  wpcontentuploadsRGartx.jpg w  width       p    p  Even fans call it the National  em  Felons  em  League  for good reason .

And Whites are still overrepresented at the position . But the  golden boys  often obscure two important facts . First  Whites are tremendously underrepresented in the NFL and major colleges  Whites make up  percent of the U.S. population but only  percent of NFL players . Secondly  White athletes are often pigeonholed into certain positions  Whites can be tightends  but only rarely widereceivers  they can maybe play safety but never cornerback  a White running back can be a  good blocker  or  role player   but not a starting tailback.  p    p  Over the last  years  the website   a href  http  castefootball.usindex.php   Caste Football  a   has put forth the provocative thesis that American footballfrom the NFL down to junior varsityis captured by  group think.  There is an assumption of Black superiority  in terms of speed  agility  flexibility  and White athletes are never given the opportunity to excel . This thesis  no doubt  carries a kernel of truth  as  group think  infects every industry . And although it is politically incorrect  it is by no means as radically taboo as the alternative explanation  that Africans are genetically predisposed to excel at football . Deron Snyder of the Black webzine  em  The Root  em  gave the  caste thesis  a  a href  https  www.theroot.comcastefootballtakesupthecauseofwhiteathletes   sympathetic hearing  a   precisely for this reason.  p    p  Blacks are not physically superior . If you believe that they are  you  ve only set yourself up for the devastating counterpunch that whites are mentally superior . Those blows of superiority and inferiority continue to hammer both sides of the racial divide . They must be fought ardently at all times . On and off the field.  p    p  Questions of  superiority  and  inferiority  ultimately miss the point . The issue is difference . And yes  Virginia  race is real . Gene pools are plastic to their environments  and over the millennia   a href  https  www.theroot.comcastefootballtakesupthecauseofwhiteathletes   races  a   that is  breeds or extended families  emerged  having adapted to their surroundings through natural selection . That races existand that some races might  by chance  be better adapted to the artificial environment of a football fieldis simply an implication of Darwinian evolution.  p    p  In   O.J . Simpson  then the star running back for the Buffalo Bills  remarked   p    p  We are built a little differently  built for speedskinny calves  long legs  high asses are all characteristics of blacks.  p    p  O.J . was right  at least about that .  em  Vis√†vis  em  Whites and Asians  West Africans have  p    p  It is beyond naive to believe that such factors would not give Africans major advantages in football . Added to this  Blacks develop faster than Whites  who  in turn  mature faster than Asians  . Black mothers have  a href  https  academic.oup.comijearticle   shorter gestation periods  a    weeks   Blacks babies tend to hold their heads up and sit up sooner in the crib  and Blacks experience puberty at a younger age . Developmental disparity has a major impact in determining which players get recruited for major colleges  and which go on to the next level.  p    p  No surprisingly  the paradigmatic PC scandalin which a mainstream figure was denounced and personally destroyed for expressing an opinioninvolved the anthropology of football.  p    p  In   beloved commentator Jimmy  the Greek  Snyder  a href  https  www.washingtonpost.comarchivepoliticsjimmythegreeksaysblacksarebredforsportsaeeabdade  utmterm.fdbc   observed  a   on Martin Luther King  s birthday  no less   p    p  I  m telling you that the black is the better athlete . . . And he  s bred to be the better athlete because this goes all the way to the Civil WAR when  during the slave trading  the owner  the slave owner  would breed his big woman so that he would have a big black kid  see.  p    p  The huge uproar that resulted occurred precisely because everyone knew that  the Greek  was getting at the truth . And as nutrition  training  and technology reach their limits in allowing athletes to realize their potential  genetic factors are likely to become even more important going forward.  p    p  Among the bestselling  a href  https  www.fanatics.comnfljerseysodz   NFL jerseys  a   White quarterbacks and tight ends  Carson Wentz  Rob Gronkowski  and Tom Brady  et al .  predominateto a degree  no doubt  that embarrasses the league .

Such things demonstrate the yearning White fans have to root on White playersa yearning that will never be fulfilled in the foreseeable future . Put simply  the NFL is a Black league . It was not always a Black league  but it will be for the duration .

But even he could not envision what was to take place at universities over the next halfcenturytheir transformation into entertainment industry.  p    p  The modern university system is a tremendous burden on society  behemoth institutions in which administrators outnumber instructors and students get saddled with lifelong debt in hopes of earning a golden ticket to the middle class . College football isn  t solely to blame for this trend  but it hasn  t helped either . And it makes a mockery of supposed  research institutions  and  colleges of the liberal arts  that act as governmentsubsidized minor leagues for the NFL.  p    p  Beginning in   the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill came under scrutiny after a football player tweeted about partying with a famous sports agent at a lavish Miami nightclub . The investigations uncovered the reality  both sad and hilarious  of life at a  big time  university  classes were effectively daycare sessions for yearold illiterates  random payouts and favors were ubiquitous  socalled  tutors  literally did the reading and writing on behalf of players  and all of it operated through the AfricanAmerican Studies Department.  p    p  The Carolina scandal can ultimately be laughed off . It is shocking only to the most na√Øve  and no one got hurt . The same can not be said of the case involving the  Baylor Bruins   an allfemale  hostess  program for prized recruits at Baylor University . One young woman who joined this program in   Elizabeth Doe  claims at least  rapes were committed by some  Baylor players over the course of four years . A  a href  https  www.washingtonpost.comnewsearlyleadwpbaylormovestodismisslawsuitallegingrapesbyfootballplayers  utmterm.edaeefce   telling quote  a  from these allegations comes from Kendal Briles  an assistant football coach and son of former head coach Art Brile   p    p  Do you like white women  Because we have a lot of them at Baylor  and they love football players.  p    p  Some of the alleged victims were female athletes in other sports  including a volleyball player who  a href  http  www.vdare.compoststhebaylorfootballprogramsblackrapeculturepushedbywhitecoachesandprotectedbywhiteadministrators   claims  a  she was gang raped.  p    p  Baylor first attempted to get the case dismissed . When that failed  it reached a settlement with Elizabeth Doe . Two of the accused players await criminal trials . The head coach  along with his staff  was fired . Chancellor Ken Starr  yes   em  that  em  Ken Starr  resigned under pressure . Needless to say  the football goes on.  p    p  How could anyone really expect such an appalling fiasco not happen somewhere  College athletes are in a legitimately unfair position of being pros who don  t get paid  at least not officially and regularly  . And colleges compete with fringe benefits . And those benefits will include women.  p    p  But again  the deeper question is how football makes people act and think . For those fanatics at Baylor and Carolina  at stake was not just wins and loses and not just school pride . At stake was the myth of the  student athlete   that of racial equality  and the necessity of presenting Southern schools as progressive and morally redeemed . Who wouldn  t fudge some numbers  pass money under the table  and look the other way as a few women get abused for such a righteous cause   p    p  Throughout Middle America and the South  a football coach is a man upheld as a Patton of the gridiron  part field general  part strategic mastermind  part father figure  occasional peptalker and bearhugger . He must be serious and stern  only cracking a smile when carried off the field by his players or doused with Gatorade . The coach is an avatar of an oldschool authoritarian with a warm heart  a figure millions of Whites instinctively admire . The fact that  Coach  is used as a kind of formal appellation  much like  Herr Professor Schmidt  or  President Reagan   speaks to the reverence the profession commands.  p    p  In reality  coaches are closer to being babysitters or  yes  I  ll say it   em  plantation managers  em  . And most are highfunctioning morons  smart enough to understand a wishbone offense and the intricacies of  Cover    but dumb enough to be blissfully unaware of the absurdity of their profession and the terrible impact it has on society . In this regard  listening to Rex Ryan  s  a href  https  nypost.compissedoffrexryanhassomedonaldtrumpregrets   selfrighteous burbling  a  about Donald Trump offers a certain delight.  p    p   span class  embedyoutube  style  textalign  center  display  block     iframe allowfullscreen  true  class  youtubeplayer  height    src  https  www.youtube.comembedJWdIC  version  amp  rel  amp  fs  amp  autohide  amp  showsearch  amp  showinfo  amp  ivloadpolicy  amp  wmodetransparent  style  border   type  texthtml  width      iframe   span   p    p  The  great  coachesnot the Rex Ryans but the legends and iconspossess the personality types of the modern politician  they balance the desire to win at all cost with the need to go with the PC flow  they nod to the values and  em  mores  em  of their White fans  while kowtowing to ownership or their schools   booster  societies . They are never leaders in the true sense of word.  p    p  Paul  Bear  Bryantwhose coaching career    spanned Alabama  s transition from allWhite to  integrated  to majority Black teamsis a classic example in this regard . Shortly before his death  Bryant  a href  http  bleacherreport.comarticleshowbearbryantbecamethebranchrickeyofalabama   claimed  a  that he wanted to be remembered as the  Branch Rickey of football   a reference to the Brooklyn Dodgers General Manager who brought Jackie Robinson into Major League Baseball  . Such a statement can only be read as revisionist delusions of an dying man . Bryant never openly opposed segregationnever went against Governor George Wallace or Alabama  s White fansdespite the fact that he was the most popular man in the state at the time  and despite the fact that he actively wanted to recruit Black players . Alabama was late to integrate even for the Southeastern Athletic Conference  and Bryant is most remembered for his three National Titles in the s won with allWhite Teams.  p    p  On September     Bryant scheduled  at his own discretion  a game against the University of Southern California Trojans  an integrated team with a Black quarterback . Alabama was overmatched physically  and lost by three touchdowns    . There are competing narratives about the event . The first is that a kind of culture clashor race wartook place  in which the bright  integrated future traveled to the benighted Deep South  and won . The other narrative is more complicated . Bryant had already tried to recruit Black athletes and failed  due to the players  own discomforts and pressure from the University . The USC game was thus an opportunity to prove to his fans the necessity of integration . In other words  it was football blackmail   em  Do you want to stay White  Or do you want to win   em  USC players reported that when Bryant went to shake hands with his USC counterpart  John McCay  he came with a beaming smile on his face   John  I can  t thank you enough.  An  a href  https  www.theatlantic.comentertainmentarchivetheintegrationofcollegefootballdidnthappeninonegame   apocryphal legend  a  has it that Bryant brought USC running back Sam Cunningham into the Alabama locker room and presented him to his players   Gentlemen   em  this  em  is a football player.  Whatever the case  the game proved to be a symbolic turning point  for Alabama and all of college football . Dennis Royal  s  University of Texas squad was the last White team to win a National Title . By   Alabama would be integrated  followed by LSU and Ole Miss a year later.  p    p  It is precisely Bryant  s ambiguity that continue to make him a compelling and magisterial figure for millions of football fans . He became a  progressive  without actually risking anything . In turn  his demeanor and airhis grey and plaid suits and checkered and houndstooth fedorasgrant Bryant a proudly conservative presence  even more so than the flamboyant and d√©class√© figures associated with the battles against desegregation . But such a persona ultimately rings hallow when tested . At least genuine leftists openly strove to transform society  institutions  marriage and the family . Bear Bryant wanted Black players in order to beat USC . In turn  fans  adoration of the Great White Coacha Bryant or Bowden or Sabancommanding an allBlack team represents the last gasp of a defeated people   em  At least we have our football   em   p    p  Football was once a midwestern oddity and favorite sport of the Ivy League . Today  it lays claim to being  America  s Game  even more than the onetime  National Pastime   baseball . Baseball is baseball everywhere  from Los Angeles to Mexico City to Tokyo   but  Canadian football  or  Australian football  are different games entirely . Thus  American football has emerged as a civic nationalism  indeed  one of the few things citizens of a multiracial and multicultural republic can claim to hold in common.  p    p   img class  alignnone sizefull wpimage  height    sizes   maxwidth  px  vw  px  src  wpcontentuploadsgettyimages.jpg  srcset  wpcontentuploadsgettyimages.jpg w  wpcontentuploadsgettyimagesx.jpg w  width       p    p  It is thus not surprising that the American military is now a prominent part of the NFL . The NFL has  in fact  dedicated the entire month of November to the U.S. military   Salute To Service    in which players and coaches add camouflage  flair  to the uniforms .  This comes after  a href  http  www.nfl.compink   NFL Pink  a   formerly known as October  in which the NFL requires players to be decked out in girly gloves  towels  and cleats  ostensibly in support of breast cancer awareness .   p    p  None of this is altruistic . Between  and   the Department of Defense spent more than   million on  marketing and advertising contracts with professional sports teams.  Among that  some  . million of taxpayer funding went to  NFL teams . These contracts gave the military the right to present aircraft flyovers  unfurl enormous flags  and hold colorguard ceremonies and even enlistment campaigns at NFL games .  The DoD payouts to the NFL ended in   after much criticism . The monthlong   a href  http  www.nfl.comSalute   Salute to Service  a   continues .   p    p  The military capitalizes on the goodwill generated by football as a communitarian public spectacle . In turn  the NFL has been able to maintain a perpetual    atmosphere  in which attending sports is synonymous with  supporting the troops.  Perhaps the NFL  s symbolic propaganda message is that it is  in fact  another branch of the military.  p    p  There are certainly traditionalist aspects to this connection between the American people  the military  and violent spectacle  in the conservative  s imagination  the military represents a culture of honor and discipline  just as the NFL is a space in which strength and manliness still mean something . But all of this is botched and turned into parody . The military wouldn  t embrace football if it didn  t see it as an opportunity for generating uncritical support for its overseas wars and sprawling industrial complex . And football  in turn  embraces war and the troops in a desperate attempt to cover over its own immense failings . In taking up the anthem controversyand even suggesting the prospect of obligatory patriotismDonald Trump was hardly questioning any of this . He sought  in fact  to reinforce the martial quality of footballand  you could say  this football quality of the military . The ultimate outcome will be quite the opposite  as both industries are experiencing collapse in their public legitimacy.  p    p  We must ask now how these impulses towards manliness  power  and danger might head might be expressed in football  s absense  Football lays claim to being the most badass of sports  crushing hits  terrifying injuries  bodies being laid out on the groundall of this set out for your amusement . And unlike boxing or mixed martial arts  football is a war game  with trenches  helmets  field generals  battles for territory  long bombs  and Hail Marys . Liberals traditionally dislike football for these reasonsit offends their desire to be both individualistic and cooperative.  p    p  Football fandom also appeals to traditionally  male  activities such as eating greasy food  hanging out with  the boys   and drinking beer . The purpose of the  man cave   after all  is to watch sports . And unlike playing video games or watching art films  it doesn  t carry any effeminate connotations . But the manliness of football is precisely why watching it is so insidious . Football offers a substitute manliness  quite literally.  p    p  The right side of the brain possesses  mirror neurons   which help us vicariously experience the actions of others . As one researcher  a href  http  www.medicaldaily.commindandbodysportsfansportsgames   described  a  it   p    p  This phenomenon allows a feeling of connection  and community without verbal communication or the need to directly talk to the pro athlete who just won the World Series with a grand slam.  p    p   Mirroring  is  no question  an essential part of life . Empathy and vicarious experiences allow us to learn from others and enjoy storytelling by projecting ourselves onto the protagonist . But intently watching a game is an experience of the  em  hyperreal  em   similar to having sex by watching Internet porn . On a basic level  the mind doesn  t grasp the difference . HighDefinition images become a virtual reality  and you get off just the same.  p    p   img class  alignnone sizefull wpimage  height    sizes   maxwidth  px  vw  px  src  wpcontentuploadsDraggedImage.png  srcset  wpcontentuploadsDraggedImage.png w  wpcontentuploadsDraggedImagex.png w  wpcontentuploadsDraggedImagex.png w  width       p    p  The benefits of a  tough  sportstrength  courage  comradeship with a teamcome from playing it . Simply watching it  and engaging in activities which make you weaker  makes you a consumer of toughness . I hesitate to extend the metaphor too far  But it would be like saying seducing women is the peak of masculinity  and then spending all day watching pornography with a group of your friends.  p    p  The System doesn  t want us to  em  do  em   it wants us to  em  watch  em  . It doesn  t want us to create but consume  to watch porn  not make love or produce familes . All experience is to be moderated  all value  monetized and commodified  and all community  reduced to brands . Fandom itself is an expression of the  em  loss  em  at the heart of the modern world . Men want to fight and win  be part of a gang  sacrifice for glory  and be rewarded with fame and women .  Even nerds want this  as they gravitate to videogames of war  conquest  chivalry  and violence .   Fandom  is the collective identity the system is willing to offer us.  p    p  Our real task is to create a new culture . And the only way to do that is to  em  just do it  em   to borrow corporate slogan from sports world  . This means spending time with friends and family  playing  not just watching  sports  getting strong  participating in meetups and activism  and building institutions.  p    p  Fandom transforms manly impulsesthe desire for community  the attraction to strength and accomplishment  the wish for spectacleinto weaknesses . And in so doing  transforms White men into sources of revenue for people who despise them.  p    p  So be a man . Stop being a fan.  p    p   MLK Day  has become the high holy day of the American liturgical calendar . No other statesman  not Washington  Jefferson  or Lincoln  is deemed worthy of a holiday all to his own . And no other national holiday seems to carry such relevant  pressing meaning for Americans as the third Monday in January . The th of July has become an excuse for a backyard barbecue . The MLK anniversary  on the other hand  inspires Americans to ask who we are and what our higher ideals should be.  p    p   MLK Day  has become the high holy day of the American liturgical calendar .

The MLK anniversary  on the other hand  inspires Americans to ask who we are and what our higher ideals should be.  p    p  NPI  s cofounder   a href  http  www.amren.comfeaturesthekingholidayanditsmeaning   Samuel Francis  a   who was active in the debates about the institution of the holiday in mid  s  recognized then that the significance of Martin Luther King Jr. stretched far beyond the legal and political technicalities of the Civil Right Act . The celebration of the man represented a great change in how Americans understood their nation.  p    p   T  he true meaning of the holiday is that it serves to legitimize the radical social and political agenda that King himself favored and to delegitimize traditional American social and cultural institutions  not simply those that supported racial segregation but also those that support a free market economy  an anticommunist foreign policy  and a constitutional system that restrains the power of the state rather than one that centralizes and expands power for the reconstruction of society and the redistribution of wealth . In this sense  the campaign to enact the legal public holiday in honor of Martin Luther King was a small first step on the long march to revolution  a charter by which that revolution is justified as the true and ultimate meaning of the American identity . In this sense  and also in King  s own sense  as he defined it in his speech at the Lincoln Memorial in   the Declaration of Independence becomes a  promissory note  by which the state is authorized to pursue social and economic egalitarianism as its mission  and all institutions and values that fail to reflect the dominance of equality  racial  cultural  national  economic  political  and social  must be overcome and discarded.  p    p  By placing King  and therefore his own radical ideology of social transformation and reconstruction  into the central pantheon of American history  the King holiday provides a green light by which the revolutionary process of transformation and reconstruction can charge full speed ahead . Moreover  by placing King at the center of the American national pantheon  the holiday also serves to undermine any argument against the revolutionary political agenda that it has come to symbolize . Having promoted or accepted the symbol of the new dogma as a defining  perhaps the defining  icon of the American political order  those who oppose the revolutionary agenda the symbol represents have little ground to resist that agenda.  p    p  Sam is all too correct that  MLK writ large  has become the foundation of American identity  in many ways  the situation is far worse than the one he depicted in .  p    p  At the time  Sam described a pitched battle between MLK  s egalitarian  Dream  and  traditional American social and cultural institutions   which he describes  in Cold War language  as  antiCommunist foreign policy   freemarkets  and the Constitution.  p    p  What Sam might not have grasped in   but understood fully later  is that by the turn of the st century  the MLK counterculture  em  was  em   and  em  is  em   the Establishment . There are precious few  traditional American social and cultural institutions  that do not honor MLK or treat  The Dream  as informing their missions.  p    p  And this is not solely the case for the more overtly liberal ones like the Department of Education . No less a putative bastion of conservative values than the U.S. Army is led by men like FourStar General George Casey  who in   in response to a Muslim Army Major who murdered  of his fellow soldiers as an act of  em  jihad  em   averred   p    p  What happened in Fort Hood was a tragedy . But I believe it would become an even greater tragedy if our Diversity becomes a casualty . And it  s not just about Muslims . We have a very diverse Army  we have a very diverse society  and that gives us all strength.  p    p  MLK unites the Left  tactical disputes between Malcolm X and the pacifist reverend have long since gone by the wayside  . And in a strange way  he  a href  http  twitchy.comamendrbencarsonnailsitwithsimplekeypointonmlkday   unites the Right  a  as well .  Judged By The Content Of Their Character  is the central  if not  em  sole  em   argument against multiculturalism and affirmativeaction offered forth by selfstyled  conservatives.  And King is counted as an American icon and hero not only at leftwing and liberal gatherings but at those of the  Religious Right  and Beltway Republicans.  p    p   a href  altrightarchivealtrightarchivemainblogsdistrictofcorruptiontheglennbeckdeception   Glenn Beck  a  who  in his radio and television programs and  a href  journaltheoldtimereligion   mass rallies  a   has created a kind of religion of MLKmight actually turn Sam  s polemic on its head and claim that MLK  em  is  em  the hero of American foreign policy and Constitutional government . And he would  in a sense  be correcteven in the matter of foreign affairs . Washington  s violent incursions into the Middle East are invariably accompanied by promises that all shall vote  women shall attain undergraduate educations  and minorities shall be empowered.  p    p  Despite conservatives  wishful thinking  The Dreamin all its manifestationsis the antithesis of a free society . Government  s enforcing that all people and businesses make judgments nonracially is  in itself  a totalitarian notion and has  in fact  resulted in a massive interventionist infrastructure and bureaucracy .  Rand Paul tepidly  a href  altrightarchivealtrightarchivemainblogsdistrictofcorruptionwhyrandneedshbd   hinted  a  at as much during his  Senate campaign .  The  a href  http  www.thenationalpolicyinstitute.orgpdfcostofdiversity.pdf   costs  a  of the industry of  civil rights  and  diversity training  in the workplace can be measured in the hundreds of billions  if not trillions  per year .  And  em  pace  em  conservative revisionism  the actual Martin Luther King Jr.  a href  http  www.lewrockwell.comarchivesfm.html   unequivocally advocated  a  most all of the measures done in his name .   p    p  More deeply   nondiscrimination  as a value is the enemy of all tradition  not just the AngloSaxon American society it has helped destroy . The version of The Dream that conservatives likethat of interracial handholding and vague libertarianismis ultimately a vision of raceless  familyless  classless  historyless individuals  happily experiencing equality with other individuals of various shades  all integrated by the marketplace and government . Tradition is  at its root  about being a part of something larger than oneself . The Dream is about becoming a selfcontained atom.  p    p  Conservatives might think it cute to quote some of King  s more libertarian utterances back at liberals  as a form of  PC Judo.  But in the end  they will be the losers of such a gambit.  br  Martin Luther King Jr.  a  a href  http  www.lewrockwell.comorigepstein.html   fraud  a  and  a href  http  www.worldaffairsbrief.comkeytopicsMLK.shtml   degenerate  a  in his life  has become the symbol and cynosure of White Dispossession and the deconstruction of European civilization .  em  We shall overcome   em   p    p   em  This essay was first published on January     at RadixJournal.com and NPIAmerica.org.  em   p    p   p    p  No one likes to be the object of criticism  Americans no more than any other people .

And when someone is the target of criticism  he should not be expected always to agree with it . It is important  however  to comprehend that criticism  to take it seriously on its own terms  and not just dismiss it as inspired by malice  jealousy or ignorance.  p    p  The criticism that the French New Right  NR  has leveled at America has earned it an unjustifiable label of being inspired by some kind of hidden French chauvinism or  antiAmerican  phobia . And too often the New Right  s criticism has been poorly understood . Some Americanswho are themselves critical of what their country has now become and the way it has evolvedassume that the criticism is aimed primarily at the America of today . This is not true . The criticism the NR addresses against America is aimed  in fact  at the very foundation of what we call the  American ideology  an ideology going back to the Founding Fathers . Or to put it differently  this is not a criticism of multiracial  or  multicultural   America of modern and postmodern times  but primarily a criticism aimed at the America created by Whites and AngloSaxon Christians.  p    p  As a way of adding some final touches to Tomislav Sunic  s book  I  d like to outline the general thrust of this criticism.  p    p  Europe has never declared war on the United States . It is clear  however  that from its very beginning  the United States of America has had a score to settle with Europe . America was born out of desire to break up with Europe . What immigrant communities in the New World first and foremost desired was to dispense with the rules and political principles that prevailed in Europe . The American nation was born in a contractual form during the era of modernity  evoking largely the  primal scene  as imagined by Sigmund Freud  the children get together in order to kill their father and afterwards they draft a contract sanctioning the relationship between equals.  p    p  Evidently  the father in that scheme was Europe . It was necessary to make a clean break with the past in order to create a new humankind . Thus  in the  em  Federalist Papers  em  we read   p    p  Had no important step been taken by the leaders of the Revolution for which a precedent could not be discovered  no government established of which an exact model did not present itself  the people of the United States might  at this moment have been numbered among the melancholy victims of misguided councils  must at best have been laboring under the weight of some of those forms which have crushed the liberties of the rest of mankind . Happily for America and we trust for the whole human race  they pursued a new and more noble course . They accomplished a revolution which has no parallel in the annals of human society . They reared the fabrics of governments which have no model on the face of the globe.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  Likewise  it was against Europe that in December  James Monroe stated the central tenet of his famous  Doctrine   that is  that no European intervention should be tolerated at any point whatsoever on the American continent .  We have listened too long to the courtly muses of Europe   exclaimed for his part the poet and philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson in the th century .  In many respects   as Dominique Moisi and Jacques Rupnik remark   p    p  America is antiEurope . It was born out of desire to create a  new Jerusalem  on earth in order to overcome the limitations and errors of the European history.  p    p  Given that U.S. citizenship is founded on a contract between immigrants of diverse origins  it follows that all cultural idiosyncrasies must be relegated into the private sphere  which means that they must be temporarily held outside the notion of citizenship . This requirement perfectly matches with the individualist philosophy of the Founding Fathers . It was in America  for the first time ever  that a society was construed composed exclusively of individuals and not of groups  just as capitalism itself presupposed a brand of individualism oriented first toward the property possession.  p    p  Sometimes the indifference of the Americans toward history is explained by a relative short duration of the existence of their country . This explanation does not sound convincing . After all  two centuries is a long stretch of time . In fact  the problem is not so much that Americans  have no history  but rather that they do not wish to have one . And they do not wish to have one because  for them  the past is reminiscent of their European roots  which they once attempted to discard .  This is the only people without any roots and genealogy   wrote  quite fondly  the liberal author Guy Sorman . Thomas Jefferson expressed the same idea by saying that each generation forms a  separate nation.   The dead   he said   have no rights.  Daniel Boorstin  the former director of the Library of Congress  wrote that  the notion of hyphenated Americans is unAmerican.  p    p  I believe that there are only Americans . PolishAmericans  ItalianAmericans  or AfricanAmericans are an emphasis that is not fertile . Americans prefer to be called by their first names and abandon the names of their heritage . The same applies to objects  the trend being toward the unsustainable and the disposable.  p    p  The same observation was made by Christopher Lasch  who wrote that in the U.S.  the removal of the roots has always been seen as the prerequisite for increased freedoms.  Hence  America can be described as a civilization of space and not a civilization of time . Its founding myth is not the origin  but the frontier  which in  Frederick Jackson Turner interpreted as the most representative notion of the American ideal  that is  the aspiration toward  the conquest of space.   What other people experience as history   observes JeanPaul Doll√©   the Americans perceive as a sign of underdevelopment.   p    p  And the Americans did not wish to break up with only Europe . They also wanted to create a new society that would regenerate mankind . They wanted to create a new  promised land  that would become the model of the Universal Republic . This Bibleinspired theme  based on the idea of the  chosen  America  has  from its outset and by a purported divine choice  constituted the foundation of a  civil religion  and of American  exceptionalism.  It has kept resurfacing as a leitmotif throughout American history  ever since the days of the Pilgrims  as for instance when the Massachusetts Bay theologian John Cotton suggested the adoption of Hebrew as the official language for the former British colonies . John Winthrop  the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony  which was founded in   asserted   p    p  We must always consider that we shall be as a city upon a hillthe eyes of all people are upon us . Today the eyes of all people are truly upon usand our governments  in every branch  at every level  national  state and local  must be as a city upon a hill.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  Similar statements were made by William Penn  the chief of the Quaker colony of future Pennsylvania  only to be echoed by the settlers of Virginia .

And also to continue to proceed in a manner that would eventually lead the whole world to impregnate itself with the idea that the American society is the perfect society and that the descendants of the Puritans are God  s elect . Besides  it is the Puritan theology of the  covenant  that inspired the doctrine of Manifest Destiny  as put forward by John L. O  Sullivan in    p    p  Our national birth was the beginning of a new history  the formation and progress of an untried political system  which separates us from the past and connects us with the future only  and so far as regards the entire development of the natural rights of man  in moral  political  and national life  we may confidently assume that our country is destined to be the great nation of futurity .

On the other hand  there is a need for the  crusade  the world must gradually be penetrated with the universal values of the American system . In economics  freetrade policies have never prohibited the use of protectionism  whenever this was deemed necessary  similarly  in foreign policy  isolationism  coupled with the spirit of  crusade   can march hand in hand . These are the two sides of the same messianic vocation and a typical example of how political universalism is just a mask for ethnocentrism  that is to say  a peculiar model with planetary ambitions.  p    p  This underlying certitude explains the extraordinary stability of the U.S. system . In the course of its history  the United States has known only one important political model  a model which has virtually remained unchanged ever since the days of the Founding Fathers . The Constitution  largely inspired by Locke  and generally speaking by the philosophy of Enlightenment  and vetted through Puritanism  has become a sort of sacred monument that makes of Americanism a genuine religion . Be they on the right or on the left  all Americans are in agreement that they have a mission to spread  the word  to mankind . Even the most frenzied utopians do not call into question the authority of the Constitution or the superiority of individual initiative . The system can be tentatively improved or reformed  but it must be remain fundamentally unchanged  insofar as it meshes with the very existence of the country . Whereas in Europe it is still possible to refer to some of the countless political models that existed in the past  the political debate in America reduces itself to discussions about the relative merits of Hamilton  Jefferson  Washington  et al . Fascism and Communism have never had any real impact on the United States  nor has the idea of counterrevolution  nor critical Marxism  nor revolutionary syndicalism  nor anarchosyndicalism  situationism  etc . At universities  Political Science courses often evolve around long discussions about the work of the Founding Fathers  who are portrayed as people of unsurpassable legacy . Even the eternal debate between Federalists and Antifederalists  between the Hamiltonians and the Jeffersonians  is  in fact  a family feud  which never calls into question the underlying political consensus.  p    p  American domestic politics is often reduced to a competition between the two major parties  which in the eyes of the Europeans say more or less the same thing . Electoral competitions  with their conventions organized as circus shows  are entirely dependent on money .  Democracy  in America equals financial oligarchy . The elections are financial effusions of the billionaire class . For the Americans  it is considered natural that politicians must be richin my view  society should be extremely skeptical of anyone who is rich and powerful at the same timejust as it is natural for the politicians to exhibit their wives and children in public meetings  while multiplying religious slogans in their speeches . In continental Europe  a headofstate addressing his constituents with  God bless you   and inviting the parliamentarians to a day of prayer and fasting would be viewed by many as a person ripe for the mental asylum . . .  p    p  The flip side of this institutional paralysis is formidable conformism and extraordinary monotony of a society that  decade after decade  asserts  with the same docile conviction  that America is a  free country   while adhering to the same modes  abiding by the same conventions  repeating the same slogans  and  of course  wearing the same uniforms  jeans and T shirts with a logo of a university that one never attended or a baseball team of which one is not a member  . This monotony was already described by Alexis de Tocqueville  who noted that the sequence of commotion and fleeting fashions never augur anything new in America . About the same time the Countess of Merlin also remarked that life of the Americans is  an eternal course in geometry.   p    p  The same messianic certitude inspires American foreign policy  whose main principle is that what is good for America must also be good for the rest of the worldwhich  in turn  must allow America to expect from its allies financial contributions and applause . As a secularized guise of the Puritan ideal  foreign policy is based on the idea that only the lack of information or the intrinsic evil of foreign leaders explains the reluctance of people around the world to embrace the American way of life . As Jean Baudrillard wrote  the United States is a society  p    p  whose naivet√© can be described as unbearable and whose fixed idea is that America is the perfect completion of everything that others dream about.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p   International relations  is nothing but a global diffusion of the American ideal on the planetary level . Since they assume that they represent the model of perfection  American do not feel obliged to get to know others . It remains for others to adopt the American way .  The tradeoff is uneven   observes Thomas Molnar   because America has nothing to learn but everything to teach.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  And indeed  everything that happens in America must eventually happen elsewhere in the world . In other words  foreign policy has for a goal the creation of unified humanity no longer in need of any foreign policy . Under such circumstances one must not be surprised that setbacks encountered by the United States in the international arena are often the results of America  s inability to comprehend that other peoples think differently than they do . In fact  for the Americans  the external world   the rest of the world   simply does not exist  or rather it exists in so far as it becomes Americanizeda necessary precondition to become comprehensible.  p    p  Many observers have noticed the importance of religion in the American society .  In God we trust  is written on all banknotes  and since   it has become a national motto . In the United States  almost all official ceremonies are preceded or followed by a prayer . As of   the Reverend J.B. Soames declared in Washington  during a solemn blessing of the military equipment   If Jesus Christ came back to Earth he would be white  American and proud of it   Tocqueville already observed   p    p  It is the religion that gave birth to the AngloAmerican societies . One must never forget this  in the United States  religion is therefore intermingled with all the national habits and all the sentiments to which a native country gives birth.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  Religion is often redefined in an optimistic sense  consistent with the requirements of practical materialism and aspirations of the people who has never ceased to believe in the virtues of technology and who spontaneously assumegiven that the sense of the tragic is alien to itthat somehow things will always sort themselves out in the end . The well known American professor Thomas L. Pangle  in his study on Montesquieu and his influence on the Founding Fathers  suggests the adoption of liberal  commercial republicanism and the spirit of commerce as the best regime  p    p  fundamentally opposed  not only to insecurity  but also to both the austere civic virtue of republican antiquity and to religious selftranscendence or otherworldliness.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  The bottom line is the reconciliation of religion with optimism inherited from the Enlightenment and embedded in the direction pointing toward the future and the mystique of progress . From John Winthrop to George W. Bush and Barack Obama  the Americans have never given up on the belief in progress  which often leads them to the conclusion that material and technological developments will also bring about the betterment of mankind . In this world of ours  only through the hoarding of material goods can a person be saved . Hence the idea of  redemption  through the conversion to the American way of life . Calvinism had already tried to solve this problem of  predestination  by interpreting material success as a sign of divine election . The glorification of individual performance  the spirit of capitalism  the pacifying virtues of  smooth trade   all of this nurtures hopes that the accumulation of wealth will someday erase all evil . Evil becomes a  mistake   a state of imperfection that must be eventually surpassed by increased trade and economic  development.  From now on  it is no longer ethics that justify interests but interest that attempt to justify ethics . In his letter of   addressed to Thomas Law  Jefferson wrote   The answer is that nature has constituted utility to man the standard and best of virtue.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  One hundred years later  Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes added   p    p  the best test of truth is the power of thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market  and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  It seems that in America truth has become a commercial issue.  br  Televangelists preach the  prosperity gospel  getting rich is a sign of getting savedbefore making their constant fundraising appeals.  p    p  The Puritans had retained from Locke the idea that all other human rights derive from  natural right of property.  For Madison   the first goal of the government  is to ensure the acquisition of property . In   he said  In a word  as a man is said to have a right to his property  he may be equally said to have a property in his rights.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  Rights are interpreted as inherent attributes of human nature  something that individuals possess because of their membership to the human species  and it is those rights that governments are bound to  ensure.   p    p  The New Right totally rejects this notion of subjective rights  which are absolutely opposed to the traditional notion of objective law . In this view  law is an equity relationship  enabling everyone to get what he deserves . Similarly  the New Right rejects the idea that private property must be an absolute.  p    p  Such an idea of man was inherent to the foundations of a society  aptly described by Ezra Pound as a  purely commercial  br  civilization.  His words echo Tocqueville  s   p    p  The passions that agitate the Americans most profoundly are commercial passions and not political passions  or rather  they carry the habits of trade into politics.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  America is certainly not the first commercial republic in history  but it is the first one to have posited that nothing whatsoever should limit economic activities  as it is the cherished means of achieving the betterment of all mankind . Being on his own  the individual counts in so much as his external activity keeps growing . Naturally  only his economic performance will properly measure his worth .  In America   wrote Hermann Keyserling   people really believe that the rich are superior simply because they have money  in America  having money creates  in fact  moral rights.   p    p  Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno observed from their perspective   p    p  Here in America  there is no difference between a man and his economic fate . A man is made by his assets  income  position  and prospects . The economic mask coincides completely with a man  s inner character . Everyone is worth what he earns and earns what he is worth.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  .  p    p  Capitalist competition represents the most ethical tribunal  the rich are the  winners   and the  winners  are the righteous . This is the primacy of civilization of  em  having  em  over the civilization of  em  being  em  .  p    p  Such traits do not lend themselves to meditative thinking and inner reflection . When the link to others is solely nurtured by the respect for material goods and the Dollar Almighty  the result is alienation with no bounds . For the Americans  notes Ana√Øs Nin in his diary   it is a sin to have an inner life.  These words may sound excessive  yet they reflect the same conclusions made by the American Christopher Lasch . In the United States there is a consistent trend to believe that intelligence must be reduced to technical knowledge and that the fixation on economic matters should help dispense with the world of pure ideas . Whoever attempts to express an original and profound idea runs the risk of encountering the answer    em  Don  t be so negative . Keep it practical  Stay positive   em    p    p  For the Founding Fathers  the purpose of the government was to ensure the  inalienable rights  of individuals who were  created equal.  Thusly  political life was reduced to morality and law . The American dissident HL Mencken quipped that the very opposite was true   p    p  The worst government is the most moral . One composed of cynics is often very tolerant and humane . But when fanatics are on top  there is no limit to oppression.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  In the United States  political action must always begin with a sudden surge of moral awareness   Something must be done about it     which invariably leads to a  technical  examination of the subject matter under consideration . The law itself is a mode of expression that sets legal forms of moral characteristics inherent to the ideology of human rights . Hence  the extraordinary importance of lawyers in American politics  which Michel Crozier calls the  delirium of the proceedings  and  legal madness.  Meanwhile  the intrinsic superiority of private over public life must be loudly declared everywhere   civil society  over the world of politics  business and economic competition over the common good .  An American  be he a government official or man on the street   writes Thomas Molnar   is convinced that politics as such is a bad thing and that people need to find something else in order to communicate and establish peaceful relations.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  As I stated above  the Americans are inclined to think that evil could disappear and that it is possible to remove the tragic trait of human existence . That is why they want to abolish politics  while at the same time bring history to an end .  America was constructed in order that it can exit history   wrote Octavio Paz . The American  neoconservative  Francis Fukuyama believed to be  br  able to announce its end.  p    p  Waging war has always meant for the Americans a morality  crusade.  This is why it is not enough for them to obtain military victory only . They must also annihilate the enemy  who is invariably depicted not as a leader or state that happens to be an adversary but as the incarnation of evil . Under the guise of  humanitarian intervention  or battles against  terrorists   American wars are always  just wars   that is to say   em  justa causa  em  warsand not wars against a  em  justus hostis  em    just enemy   . Hence  the enemy must be invariably described not just as the enemy of the moment  who could eventually also become an ally in the future   but as a criminal who deserves punishment and reeducation.  p    p  The differences seem to be profound between the political thought in the continental Europe and the American mentality  marked by an economic  commercial and procedural view of the world  by the omnipresence of biblical values  as well as by technological optimism  contractualism  the language of  rights   and the belief in progress.  p    p  I think I know the United States well  as I have sojourned there on many occasions . I have travelled in all directions  from Washington  DC  to Los Angeles  from New Orleans to Key Largo  from San Francisco to Atlanta  from New York to Chicago . I have  of course  come across a number of things that I enjoyed very much . Americans are friendly and welcoming  even if human relationship is often superficial  . They have a tangible sense of community . Their biggest universities offer working conditions that the Europeans could only dream about . I can  t forget the influence that American movies had on me at a time when they were not limited to special effects or superhero nonsense . Especially impressive for me were American literature figures such as Mark Twain  Edgar Allan Poe  Herman Melville  John Steinbeck  Ernest Hemingway  John Dos Passos  William Faulkner  et al . But I also detect the reverse side of the  American way of life   culture viewed as perishable commodities  or as  entertainment   a technomorphic conception of human life designed to transform people into extended remote controlled terminals or computers  fake gender relations  automobile civilization and commercial architecture  there is more genuine sociability at an African local market than at an American supermarketa prime symbol of Western nihilism   obese children groomed by television  glorification of  winners  and the obsession with consumption  fast food  a mixture of Puritans decrees and hysteric transgressions  hypocrisy  corruption  etc . Yes  I am aware of the risk of being accused of bias . But I must admit that for the America of  golden boys   of  rednecks   of  bodybuilders  and  bimbos   of the  American dream  and cheerleaders  of  money makers  and  brokers  on Wall Street  I have no sympathy at all.  p    p  Is globalism today synonymous with Americanism  One is tempted to answer in the affirmative . The fact is that the United States has never stopped exporting its problems to the rest of the world  starting with Europe . In the opinion polls  hostility towards globalization is often accompanied by the rejection of American hegemony . Politically and culturally  globalization largely means a process of Americanization  as the dominant superpower continues to exports its merchandise  its capital  its services  its technology  but also its  industry of the imaginary   its culture  its language  its standards of living and its own worldview.  p    p  But instead of Americanization  should it not be more appropriate to speak of  Westernization   Many Americans consider themselves  Westerners  with some of them even using the term  The West  as a synonym of the  white world   politically a meaningless expression  .  p    p  Etymologically   The West  is a place where the sun sets  a place where things perish  and where history comes to an end . In the past  this term designated one of the two empires   em  pars occidentalis  em   born out of the dismemberment of the Roman Empire . Subsequently  the term became synonymous of the  Western civilization.  Today  like many other terms  it is in the process of taking on an economic aura as Western countries are primarily designed as  developed  countries . This is not a term  however  that I myself use in a positive sense . In my view   The West  has now become the vehiclein contrast to Europeof a social model that has become a mirror image of nihilism . During my travels around the world  I have witnessed what happens to rooted cultures when they are affected by  The West   traditions quickly turn into folklore for tourists  the social bond is undone  the folkways become utility oriented  the American language and the music permeate the mind  and the passion for money becomes overwhelming.  p    p  It is often understood by the expression  The West  the aggregate composed of the United States of America and Europe . But this aggregate  provided that it has ever existed  is already crumbling  as was noted some years ago by Immanuel Wallerstein.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote      a   sup  The transatlantic gap widens every day more and more . Globalization  while exacerbating competition  reveals profound divergences between European interests and American interests . On the geopolitical level  the divergences are even more glaringthe United States is a maritime power  whereas Europe is a continental power . As was shown by Carl Schmitt  the logic of Land vs. Sea represents the two conflicting logics.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  The Land is opposed to the Sea just as politics is opposed to commerce  the boundary to the wave  the telluric element to the oceanic element . Therefore  I do not identify as a  Westerner.  I am a European.  p    p  Seen from the angle of economics  capitalism was not born across the Atlantic  although it was there that it became incorporated into the national ideology  the primacy of contract  the downsizing of the state  the criticism of the  big government   the advocacy of competition and free trade  etc . It is also in the United States that the concept of  governance  was bornfirstly applied to business and then to political and social life . It must not come as a surprise that since   the U.S. economy has become the central stage of the international financial system . It was the United States that established in  the Internatioanl Monetary Fund  IMF  and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  GATT   succeeded in  by the World Trade Organization  WTO .  Those were the institutions that liberated capital movements in  in order to finance America  s deficits . In the realm of financial capital  America still retains a much higher share compared to its industrial sector . It sets the rules for international trade  whereas its monetary policies remain the chief mechanism of regulating the financial accumulation across the globe.  p    p  Just like many Europeans  I am amazed that America  s selftitled  conservatives  defend  almost without exception  a capitalist system whose expanded methodically destroys everything that they supposedly wish to conserve . Despite the structural crisis that the capitalist system has experienced over the last couple of years  American conservatives continue to celebrate capitalism as a system that allegedly respects and guarantees individual freedom  private property  and free trade . They believe in the intrinsic virtues of the market  whose mechanism they cherish as a paradigm of all social relations . They believe that capitalism has something to do with democracy and freedom . They believe in the the necessity of perpetual economic growth . They think that consumption equals happiness and that  more  is synonymous with  better.   p    p  Capitalism  however  is not  conservative.  It is the very opposite of it . Karl Marx already observed that the dismantlement of feudalism and the eradication of traditional cultures and values are the result of capitalism  which  in turn  drowns everything in the  icy water of egotistical calculation.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  Today  the capitalist system  more than ever before  is poised toward the overaccumulation of capital . It needs more trade outlets  more and more markets  and more and more profit . Well  such a goal can not be achieved unless everything that stands in its way is dismantled  starting with collective identities . A fullfledged market economy can not operate in a sustained manner unless people first internalize a fashionable culture  consumption  and unlimited growth . Capitalism can not transform the world into a vast marketwhich  to be sure  is its main objectiveunless the planet is flattened and all people renounce their symbolic imaginations and continues to indulge in a fever for the endless accumulation of something new.  p    p  This is the reason why capitalism  in its attempt to erase borders  is also a system that has turned out to be far more effective and far more destructive than Communism . The reason for this is that the economic logic places profit above everything else . Adam Smith wrote that the merchant has no homeland other than the territory where he makes the biggest profit . It is this logic of the commodity  inspired often by the United States of America  which the New Right firmly opposes.  p    p  March    br  Paris  France  p    p   em  Translated from the French by Tomislav Sunic  em   p    p  This essay serves as the Introduction to Tomislav Sunic  s Homo Americanus  A Child of the Postmodern Age  Second  Revised Edition   published in December by Radix .

This is unfortunate  because  just as in one  s personal life  it  s wise at least to know how others see you  and especially so if the other is a keen observer.  p    p  Tomislav Sunic is such an observer . As someone who has lived under Communism and has seen firsthand the workings of state terror  he is in a unique position to describe the current slide of America into what he aptly terms  soft totalitarianism.  This regime is maintained less by brute force than by an unrelenting  enormously sophisticated  and massively effective campaign to contain political and cultural activity within very narrow boundaries . Dissenters are not trundled off to jail or beaten with truncheons  but are quietly ignored and marginalized . Or they are held up to public disgrace and  wherever possible  removed from their livelihoods.  p    p  The regime is maintained by a consensus that has become part of the furniture of life  repeated endlessly in the major media and reassuringly affirmed by wiselooking professors at prestigious universities . To dissent from this consensus removes one from the mainstream and stigmatizes one as immoral and quite possibly suffering from a psychiatric disorder . One immediately thinks of attitudes on immigration . Even the most fearless mainstream opponents of immigration restrict their opposition to illegal immigrants and are careful to couch their arguments in economic or cultural  but never ethnic or racial  terms.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  One simply can not mention in polite company that the end result of this massive influx of peoples into the traditional homelands of European peoples will be displacement  a decline in their power  and ultimately  perhaps  their disappearance as an identifiable people . But there are a host of other issues that are at least as untouchable as immigration.  p    p  Soft totalitarian regimes can only be maintained by a sense of moral and intellectual legitimacythe willing assent of the vast majority of the people . Without this legitimacy  the entire apparatus of cultural control either disintegrates or transforms into hard totalitarianismthe truncheons and the gulags . But here there is a major difference between Communism in Eastern Europe and the current cultural regime in the United States . As Sunic notes   Behind the Communist semantics in Eastern Europe  there loomed a makebelieve system nobody truly believed in and which everybody  including former Communist party dignitaries  made fun of in private . In America  by contrast  many serious people  politicians  and scholars  let alone the masses  believe in . . . the message of the media.  The people who dissent from the American consensus have been successfully relegated to the fringes . The gods are still worshiped.  p    p  Sunic sees quite clearly that this moral and intellectual legitimacy is fundamentally the result of the triumph of the left as a result of World War II . This transformation occurred first in Western Europe  which has now mostly moved well beyond soft totalitarianism to the beginnings or a gulag system where there are formal legal sanctions for thought crimes . The thought crimes  enforced by liberal and conservative European governments alike  are designed to enforce the dogmas of leftist orthodoxy  most notably everything related to multiculturalism  race  immigration  and the Holocaust . Even in England  the  em  font et origo  em  of American democracy  academics are removed for stating their beliefs on scientific evidence on race differences in intelligence or criminality .  For example  in  Frank Ellis of the University of Leeds was suspended for statements supporting race differences in intelligence .     Legal sanctions enforce orthodoxies in the area of multiculturalism and anything having to do with the fascist past.  p    p  In searching for the origins of this phenomenon  one must begin  as Sunic does  by describing the forcible imposition of leftist ideology and institutions in Germany and France after World War II . As a psychologist  I am always tempted to see the origins of leftist ideological hegemony solely in psychological termsto wonder what incredible psychological defect would lead to a whole people to adopt an ideology in which they were cast as having a grave moral or psychiatric defect . But first and foremost  the triumph of the left in Europe was accomplished via a purge and reeducation of intellectuals  educators  and media figures.  p    p  As Sunic notes  the most obvious beneficiaries of this sea change were the major leftist ideologies of the th century  Marxism  psychoanalysis  and the Frankfurt School . Since much of my writing deals with Jewish issues  I can  t help noting that these ideologies have in common that they are all part of the  Culture of Critique   Intellectual and political movements originated and dominated by Jews and intended by their Jewish participants as advancing Jewish interests  such as ending antiSemitism.  p    p  Any claim that an intellectual or political movement is or was a  Jewish  movement immediately raises all kinds of red flags for most readers . Just as the ethnic interests of Europeans can not be mentioned in discussing the effects of immigration  the Jewish identifications and commitments of the people who originated and disseminated these ideas has been moved to the fringes of intellectual discourse.  p    p  But research in the ethnic motivations of people is perfectly respectable . No one would be surprised if Mexican activists proudly and explicitly advocated the interests of Mexicans in immigration and affirmative action . Nor are we surprised if Jewish activists promoted the interests of Israel . By the same logic  we shouldn  t be surprised if Jewish social scientists are motivated by their ethnic interests . It is an empirical question that can be investigated like any other question in the social sciences  and I think that the data confirms the hypothesis that the Jews who were central to the origins and influence of these movements had a strong Jewish identification and were motivated by their ethnic interests.  p    p  As usual  there is a double standard here . It is a routine for scientists like Arthur Jensen  J. Philippe Rushton  or Richard Lynn to be called  racists  when they call attention to the biological roots of race differences in intelligence or criminality . And my writing on how Jews have pursued their ethnic interests in the intellectual and political arena has been termed  antiSemitism  on more than one occasion.  p    p  Implicitly  the charge of racism or antiSemitism assumes that these writers are nothing more than ethnic activists and that their claims of scientific truth are nothing more than a fig leaf covering their ethnic interestsexactly the claim that I am making about the role of Jews in the triumph of Marxism  psychoanalysis  and the Frankfurt School.  p    p  Unfortunately  the people making these charges of  racism  and  antiSemitism  typically feel no need to dispute the scientific accuracy of the theories they are trying to discredit or even try to provide evidence of ethnic motivation of the scientists involved . Simply making the charge is sufficient . Such is the power of the Left.  p    p  Sunic is quite correct in directing most of his attention to the Frankfurt School . The Frankfurt School developed a devastatingly effective ideology that continues to reverberate in the contemporary world  even after the fall from grace of Communism and psychoanalysis.  p    p  Fundamentally the Frankfurt School attempted to develop an ideology that pathologized National Socialism . National Socialism was  first and foremost  a movement of ethnic cohesion  because of this fact  the Frankfurt School called into question  em  all  em  sources of cohesion of Western societies  Family  religion  culture  and raceethnicity . From the beginning  there was a rejection of valuefree social science research   the fetishism of facts   in favor of the fundamental priority of a moral perspective  in which Western societies were to be transformed into utopias of cultural pluralism.  p    p  According to the Frankfurt School ideology  Europeans who identify with family  nation  or race suffer from a psychiatric disorder . In the ideal Frankfurt School world  Western nations would become therapeutic states . They would be dedicated to rooting out the remnants of adherence to traditional cultural forms of family  nation  religion  and race in their citizens . And they would do so in the interests of promoting mental health  not to mention moral rectitude.  p    p  The basic logic pursued by the Frankfurt School stemmed from the fact that positive attitudes toward church  community  nation  and race tend to result in negative attitudes toward people from different religions  communities  nations  and races . As a result  successful families that inculcate family pride in their children were seen by the Frankfurt School as sources of pathology . For example   em  The Authoritarian Personality  em  a major work of the Frankfurt School intended for an American audienceclaimed that expressions of family pride were  a setting off of a homogeneous totalitarian family against the rest of the world.   p    p  In this upsidedown world  families that are proud of their ancestors  concerned with moving up socially  or even having biological heirs are viewed as pathological.In fact  one might conclude that the real agenda of  em  The Authoritarian Personality  em  is to pathologize adaptive behavior in general . Those who value highly committed marriages and cohesive families  who are upwardly mobile and seek material resources  who are proud of their families and identify with their parents  who have high selfconcepts  who believe that Christianity is a positive moral force and a spiritual consolation  who strongly identify as males or females  but not both    and who are socially successful and wish to emulate paragons of social success  e.g.  American heroes  are viewed as having a psychiatric disorder.  p    p  On the other hand  those who are socially isolated  who have negative and rebellious attitudes toward their families  who are ambivalent and insecure in their sexual identities  who have low selfesteem  who are filled with debilitating insecurities and conflicts  including insecurities about whether their parents loved them   who are moving downward in social status  and who have negative attitudes toward high social status and acquisition of material resources are viewed as the epitome of psychological health.  p    p  Psychoanalysisthat other pillar of th century leftism and the culture of critique was obviously an ideal vehicle for creating the upsidedown world of Frankfurt School ideology . A central feature of psychoanalysis is the idea that surface appearances can often overlay deep unconscious desires and conflicts . And since psychoanalysis never required any empirical evidence for such claims  it essentially allowed the Frankfurt School authors to make up any story they wanted . If the family relationships of ethnocentric subjects were very positive  Frankfurt School theorists could interpret them as surface affection  masking deep  unconscious hostilities toward their parents . Any shred of negative feelings by ethnocentric subjects toward their parents then became a lever they could use to create an imaginary world of suppressed hostility masked by surface affection.  p    p  Yet when another volume of  em  Studies in Prejudice  em  found that antiSemites had poor relationships with their parents  the results were taken at face value.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  The result was not science  but it was effective in achieving its political goals.  p    p  It is not difficult to suppose that the entire program of research of  em  The Authoritarian Personality  em  involved deception from beginning to end . This is suggested by the authors  clear political agenda and the pervasive double standard in which ethnocentrism and involvement in cohesive groups are seen as symptoms of psychopathology among nonJews  whereas Jews are simply viewed as victims of irrational Gentile pathologies and no mention is made of Jewish ethnocentrism or allegiance to their own group.  p    p  Although it is difficult to assess the effect of works like  em  The Authoritarian Personality  em  on the culture of the West  there can be little question that the thrust of this work  as well as other works inspired by psychoanalysis and its derivatives  was to pathologize adaptive behavior in general . Good parenting  upward social mobility  pride in family  religion  nation  and race were all suspect.Many of the central attitudes of the s countercultural revolution find expression in  em  The Authoritarian Personality  em   including idealizing rebellion against parents  uncommitted sexual relationships  and scorn for upward social mobility  social status  family pride  Christianity  and patriotism.  p    p  Viewed at its most abstract level  the fundamental agenda of the Frankfurt School is to influence European peoples to view concern about their own demographic and cultural eclipse as irrational and as an indication of psychopathology . People who do not identify with the basic social categories of family  religion  nation  or race would not be concerned with their demise.  p    p  In the aftermath of the Second World War  many values akin to those of  em  The Authoritarian Personality  em  were imposed on Germans though the U.S. military and occupying powers . However  the success of the Frankfurt School  and other varieties of leftist orthodoxy  do not stem solely from their adoption by governments and authorities . After all  this forcible imposition did not happen in the United States or other areas of Europe.  p    p  In the absence of a conquering army  another important source of influence  at least in America  is what one might term the Jewish intellectual and activist infrastructure of the postWorld War II era . Despite its scientific weakness  the ideology that positive attitudes about family  nation  and race resulted from disturbed parentchild relationships was promulgated by the most prestigious institutions throughout the West  and especially by elite universities and the mainstream media  as the essence of scientific objectivity.  p    p  One aspect of this effort was the production of a great many other writings that reinforced the basic ideas found in  em  The Authoritarian Personality  em  and other works of the Frankfurt School . This general intellectual onslaught is important because it produced a zeitgeist that was far more effective than one or two works by isolated authors.  p    p  A good example is  em  The Politics of Unreason  em     . This volume was part of the Patterns of American Prejudice series funded by the AntiDefamation League of B  nai B  rith and written by Seymour Martin Lipset and Earl Raab .  Raab and Lipset also wrote Prejudice and Society  published by the AntiDefamation League in  .   p    p  First and foremost  we see the close relationship between Jewish activist organizations and academic writing on ethnic relations . In the same way  the  em  Studies in Prejudice  em  series that produced  em  The Authoritarian Personality  em  was funded by the American Jewish Committee . Obviously  there is a link between academic research on ethnic relations and Jewish activist organizations like the AJC and the ADL . Raab  s career has combined academic scholarship with deep involvement as a Jewish ethnic activist . He was associated with the ADL and is Executive Director Emeritus of the Perlmutter Institute for Jewish Advocacy at Brandeis University . He was also a columnist for the San Francisco  em  Jewish Bulletin  em  .  p    p   em  The Politics of Unreason  em  analyses political and ideological expressions of ethnocentrism by Europeanderived peoples as irrational and as being unrelated to legitimate ethnic interests in retaining political power . Movements aimed at retaining or restoring the power of the Europeanderived majority of the United States are labeled  rightwing extremism.  Their politics is  the politics of despair.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  For Lipset and Raab  tolerance of cultural and ethnic pluralism is a defining feature of democracy  so that groups that oppose cultural and ethnic pluralism are by definition extremist and antidemocratic.  p    p   em  The Politics of Unreason  em  may therefore be seen as an argument that the European peoples in the United States and other areas of the Western world should not resist declines in their cultural and demographic dominance .  Analogous arguments rarely seem to surface among Jews contemplating whether Israel should remain a Jewish state .  Attempts by majorities to resist the increase in the power and influence of other groups are contrary to  the fixed spiritual center of the democratic political process.  Extremism is antipluralism . . . . And the operational heart of extremism is the repression of difference and dissent.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p   Rightwing extremism  is also condemned because of its populist tendenciesits distrust of institutions that intervene between the people and their direct exercise of power . Indeed  in the postWorld War II era   em  The Authoritarian Personality  em  was an important ideological weapon against historical American populist movements  especially McCarthyism.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p   T  he people as a whole had little understanding of liberal democracy and . . . important questions of public policy would be decided by educated elites  not submitted to popular vote.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  The conclusion of this analysis is that democracy is identified not with the power of the people to pursue their perceived interests . Rather  government is to be the province of morally and intellectually superior elites who have no commitment to the ethnic interests of the European majority  in an Orwellian turn   democracy  is defined as guaranteeing that majorities will not resist the expansion of power of minorities even if that means a decline in their own power.  p    p  The moral and intellectual elite established by these movements dominated intellectual discourse during a critical period after the Second World War and leading into the countercultural revolution of the s . As a result  college students during this period were powerfully socialized to adopt liberalradical cultural and political beliefs . These effects continue into the present era.  p    p  The importance of the intellectual infrastructure can also be seen with other intellectual and political movements . Neoconservatism illustrates the common features of this intellectual infrastructure  It has been championed by a welldefined group of mainly Jewish authors writing with shared assumptions  a common institutional base in universities and thinktanks  access to major media  and mutual admiration.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  The power of the movement comes not from the work of a few individuals but from its dissemination in the media  its legitimacy in the universities  its promotion by Jewish activist organizations  and its constant repetition in slightly different forms and for different audiences by likeminded intellectuals and writers.  p    p  However  this intellectual infrastructure did not occur in a political vacuum . Also of critical importance was the  intergroup relations movement   which was dedicated to passing legislation and disseminating these ideas in the schools . The Frankfurt School was a critical part of the intellectual justification for the  intergroup relations movement  in its effort to  eliminate prejudice and discrimination against racial  ethnic  and religious minorities  in the period following World War II.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  The intergroup relations movement was a multifaceted effort  ranging from legal challenges to racial bias in housing  education  and public employment  legislative proposals and efforts to secure their passage into law in state and national legislative bodies  efforts to shape messages in the media  educational programs for students and teachers  and intellectual efforts to reshape the intellectual discourse of academia.  p    p  As with the other movements with strong Jewish involvement  Jewish organizations  particularly the American Jewish Committee  the American Jewish Congress  and the AntiDefamation League  were the leaders . These organizations provided the major sources of funding  devised the tactics  and defined the objectives of the movement.  p    p  As was also the case with the movement to open up the United States to immigration from all areas of the world  a conscious aim of the intergroup relations movement was to prevent the development of a mass antiJewish movement in the United States  Jewish activists  p    p  saw their commitment to the intergroup relations movement as a preventive measure designed to make sure  it  the Nazis  war of extermination against European Jewrynever happened in America.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  A consistent theme emphasized the benefits to be gained by increased levels of intergroup harmony . But there was no mention that some groups  particularly Europeanderived  nonJewish groups  would lose economic and political power and decline in cultural influence.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  Based on the writings of the Frankfurt School  the intergroup relations movement disseminated the ideology that ethnocentrism and discrimination against outgroups was a mental disease and thus literally a public health problem . The assault on negative attitudes toward other groups was likened to the medical assault on deadly infectious diseases . People with the disease were described by activists as  infected   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  and terms like  virulent antiSemitism  were invented . Negative attitudes toward groups were viewed not as the result of competing group interests but rather as the result of individual psychopathology.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  The story of the Frankfurt School and the intergroup relations movement are paradigmatic examples of Jews producing formidable  effective groupsgroups able to have powerful  transformative effects on the peoples they live among . In the modern world  these traits of Jewish groups have resulted in great influence on the academic world  the political process  and the world of mainstream and elite media . In my book The Culture of Critique and monograph on neoconservatism  I have identified several influential Jewish intellectual and political movements  Boasian anthropology and the campaign against the concept of biologically based racial differences  Jewish involvement in the political Left  psychoanalysis  the Frankfurt School  the New York Intellectuals  U.S. immigration policy  and neoconservatism.  p    p  The end result of the triumph of these movements has been a tremendous increase in Jewish power and influence  and a concomitant decrease in the political and cultural power of Europeanderived peoplesethnic warfare by any other name . In general  this body of work is decidedly on the left  but a Left that is now fundamentally concerned with the dispossession of Europeans  rather than the classical Marxist emphasis on the class struggle . At the base of this activism is an understanding that the way to achieve their ethnic goals is to be able to control the culture . In reading the views of the Frankfurt School on the importance of cultural control  it struck me that those of us attempting to preserve the traditional peoples and culture of the West are in a similar situation to the Frankfurt School and the New York Intellectuals . Their complaints about the American culture of the s through the s are mirror images of the complaints that we have now.  p    p  Whereas the New York Intellectuals and the Frankfurt School felt alienated from the culture of the West  now we are the ones with feelings of alienation from the culture that has been so strongly influenced by these Jewish intellectual movements.  p    p  We are dismayed at the failure of the media to properly address White interests or even to allow expressions of White identity to be seen or heard in the mainstream media.  p    p  We are well aware that when there is a failure of media selfcensorship  there are powerful campaigns to punish the guilty parties and get them to recant.  p    p  Just as the Frankfurt School theorized  the West has come under the control of soft authoritarianism . But now the shoe is on the other foot  Power resides in the soft totalitarianism of the multicultural  multiracial  antiWhite Left.  p    p  Prior to their ascent to power  these intellectual movements decried the passivity  escapism  and conformity of American culture . Indeed  Tom Sunic mentions  the often stated European clich√© about the alleged American conformism.  Looking at the present situation  I would have to agree that Americans are conformists . Those of us who are White advocates are horrified that the vast majority of White Americans passively accept media messages filled with distorted images of Whites and their history . We are appalled that so many White Americans are far more interested in escapist entertainment  ranging from sporting events to scifi thrillers  than the future of their people . And we are dismayed by the conformity of the great mass of White Americans who are terrified of being called a  racist  or in any way violating the current taboos of political correctness . We deplore the pathetic conformists striving to uphold the rules of a society deeply hostile to their own longterm interests.  p    p  But is it really any different in Europe  Quite clearly we see the same conformity to the moral imperative of mass Third World immigration  multiculturalism  and the ideology that the traditional peoples and cultures of Europe have no legitimacy . For example  in Sweden there is enforced silence on any criticism of multiculturalism in the aboveground media . Discussing the cancellation of a talk because it was sponsored by a politically incorrect newspaper  Swedish journalist Ingrid Carlqvist comments   That  s the way it works in the New Sweden  the country I call Absurdistan . The country of silence.  Violating the silence is met with moral outrage intended to produce shunning and ostracism   p    p  The situation in Sweden is far worse than in Denmark . In Sweden NOBODY talks about immigration problems  the death of the multiculti project or the islamisation arabisation of Europe . If you do  you will immediately be called a racist  an Islamophobe or a Nazi . That is what I have been called since I founded the Free Press Society in Sweden . My name has been dragged through the dirt in big newspapers like Sydsvenskan  Svenska Dagbladet and even my own union paper  The Journalist.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  In Sweden  as in America  having a nonconforming opinions immediately results in ostracism as a moral reprobate.  p    p  Rather than see a culture controlled by the  late capitalist  media   White advocates see the culture of the West as controlled by a hostile media elite that advocates multiculturalism  the displacement of Whites  and the culture of Western suicide.  p    p  There is thus a common thread between these Jewish intellectual movements and those of us attempting to preserve the traditional people and culture of the West . We all agree in the importance of media control . Paraphrasing a Bill Clinton campaign slogan   It  s the culture  stupid.   p    p  Control of the media is critical . If there were strong media messages advocating White identity and the legitimacy of White interests  things would turn around rather dramatically and rather quickly . This is because the psychological power behind a movement of ethnic defense is far greater than the motivation that can be mustered for a multiracial  multiethnic communist revolution.  p    p  Such media messages would be able to tap into the natural wellspring of ethnic feeling . There is a deep psychological attachment to one  s people and cultureeven among us individualistic White peoplethat can easily motivate a mass movement of ethnic defense.  p    p  Often these feelings are implicit and unconscious rather than explicit and conscious . They manifest themselves in moving to neighborhoods where their children can attend school with other Whites . Or they manifest themselves in activities where they are able to enjoy the company and camaraderie of others like themselves.  p    p  These feelings are real . And they are potentially very powerful . The revolution needed to reverse the cultural tides of the last decades would therefore be far easier to pull off than the Marxist one so ardently deasired by the Frankfurt School.  p    p  Because the Jewish community has been so intimately involved in creating the therapeutic state  it is noteworthy to examine how the Jewish community responds to breaches of decorumthat is  to challenges to its hegemony . Here  the methods are quite similar to those used in postWorld War II Germany  as described by Sunic   p    p  When silencing their critics  the German authorities do not need to resort to violent means . They usually create a cultural smearing campaign whereby a cultural heretic is portrayed as a funny  pseudoscientific crank who does not merit a place in mainstream publishing houses . Moreover  the heretic is often induced into a selfmuzzling behavior making impossible any portrayal of himself as a martyr.  p    p  A good example is the response to the unflattering portrayal of the Israel Lobby by John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  The power of the Israel Lobby is legendary and has had a major effect on U.S. foreign policy  including the recent war in Iraq . The typical response has included an argument or two aimed at small pieces of the edifice erected by Mearsheimer and Walt  but the real common denominators are intimidation  guiltbyassociation  and charges of antiSemitism . The guiltbyassociation tactic appeared in the very earliest media accounts of the article and has continued to be invoked regularly . For example  David Duke has been repeatedly cited as supporting Mearsheimer and Walt . Alan Dershowitz  s page rebuttal of Mearsheimer and Walt contains no less than  references to David Duke and five references comparing Mearsheimer and Walt  s article to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  Charges of antiSemitism abound . This occurs despite the fact that David Duke is never cited as a source on foreign policy issues or anything else in the mainstream media . However  since Duke is an activist on behalf of EuropeanAmericans who is regularly linked in the media with the Ku Klux Klan  Nazism  and  White supremacy   the technique works to marginalize the work of Mearsheimer and Walteven though Mearsheimer and Walt have performed the ritual denunciation of Duke.  p    p  The sad reality is that discussing a whole host of issues related to Jews  even in a rational  informed manner  brings charges of antiSemitism and incompetent scholarship ringing down from the highest reaches of academia and the elite media . One can easily see that this is a recipe for paranoia  frustration and ultimately antiSemitism.  p    p  But the tactics of the Jewish intellectual and political infrastructure are effective because  even if they create dark suspicions about the behavior of the organized Jewish community among a few  and vague twinges of anxiety among many  these attitudes are forced to remain underground . They occur in the privacy of one  s thoughts or in guarded conversations and coded emails . And because there is more than a grain of truth to these attitudes  for some they readily give rise to apocalyptic  impossible conspiracy theories . After all  if the reality of Jewish power on issues such as Israel is as plain as the nose on your face  and you know that this power is ultimately maintained by intimidation  smear tactics  and endlessly repeated propaganda emanating from the mainstream media and elite academic institutions  at some point informed people start thinking that there  s probably a whole lot else they aren  t being told.  p    p  There is an old saying that  sticks and stones can break my bones  but words can never hurt me.  The sad reality is  however  that the vast majority of Americans in politics  the media  and academia are terrified of being labeled an antiSemite or compared to bogey men or infamous books to which they have no connection .  Obviously  the same can be said for Europeans .  This is ironic  at the least  in the case of academics  who cultivate an image of being apolitical  fearless truthseekers . Unlike politicians  who must continue to curry favor with the public in order to be reelected  and unlike media figures who have little job security  academics with tenure have no excuse for not being willing to endure labels such as  antiSemite  or  racist  in order to pursue the truth . A large part of the rationale for tenure in the first place is that academics are supposed to be willing to take unpopular positions  to forge ahead using all their brain power and expertise to chart new territories that challenge popular wisdom.  p    p  But that image of academia is simply not based in reality  as shown by an article appearing almost two months after the publication of Mearsheimer and Walt  s essay and appropriately titled  A hot paper muzzles academia.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  Instead of a roiling debate  most professors not only agreed to disagree but agreed to pretend publicly that there was no disagreement at all . At Harvard and other schools  the MearsheimerWalt paper proved simply too hot to handle and it revealed an academia deeply split yet lamentably afraid to engage itself on one of the hottest political issues of our time . Call it the academic Cold War  distrustful factions rendered timid by the prospect of mutually assured Professors refused to take a stand on the paper  either in favor or against . As one Ivy League professor noted   A lot of  my colleagues  were more concerned about the academic politics of it  and where they should come down  in that sense.   p    p  Bear in mind that the vast majority of the professors unwilling to take a stand on this issue have tenure and literally can not be fired . They are afraid not of starvation but of having their career ruined by being associated with the wrong side in this debate . The downside is that they won  t be invited to deliver papers at other universities or important conferences . They will not be able to publish their work at prestigious academic or commercial presses  or they may even have difficulty having their work published at all . They won  t be invited to the good parties or get nice summer fellowships or get asked to serve as dean or in a future administration in Washington . Or maybe their sources of funding would dry up.  p    p  And it  s pretty clear that the  wrong side  of this debate is to express publicly approval of a paper that has been denounced in the elite media as  antiSemitic.  Can anyone believe that the Alan Dershowitzes of the world are not taking names and will not hold dissidents accountable   p    p  It  s not that professors don  t want to opine on publicpolicy issues . When there are opportunities to spout righteous leftism  professors leap to the front of the line . A good example is a recent case where three White men from the Duke University lacrosse team allegedly gangraped  sodomized  and choked a black woman who had been hired as a stripper for a party.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  Despite considerable evidence that the charges were spurious  three academic departments   programs  and  professors at Duke bought an ad in the campus newspaper in which they asserted the guilt of the men and stated that  what happened to this young woman  resulted from  racism and sexism.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  But  of course  in this case  the professors who went public with their indignation knew they were part of a likeminded community and that there would be much to gain by being on the politically correct side  and little to lose if they were proven wrong  . Indeed  a university committee charged with looking into the response of the Duke administration to this incident recommended hiring more minorities in order to increase the diversity of the Duke administration.  p    p  Sadly  there is now a great deal of evidence that academics in general are careful to avoid controversy or do much of anything that will create hostility . In fact  some researchers are pointing to this fact to call into question whether tenure is justified . A recent survey of the attitudes of  professors at elite universities illustrates this quite clearly.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  Regardless of their rank  professors rated their  br  colleagues as  p    p  reluctant to engage in activities that ran counter to the wishes of colleagues . Even tenured full professors believed  other full professors  would invoke academic freedom only  sometimes  rather than  usually  or  always   they chose confrontational options  rarely   albeit more often than did lower ranked colleagues . . . . Their willingness to selflimit may be due to a desire for harmony andor respect for the criticisms of colleagues whose opinions they value . Thus  the data did not support the depiction of Professorus Americanus as unleashed renegade.  p    p  Seen in this context  the reaction to Mearsheimer and Walt makes a lot of sense . As one professor noted   People might debate it if you gave everyone a getoutofjailfree card and promised that afterwards everyone would be friends.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  This intense desire to be accepted and liked by one  s colleagues is certainly understandable . It is probably part of human nature . There have been times when I have had to endure charges of antiSemitism  most recently in an article by Jacob Laksin titled  Cal State  s Professor of AntiSemitism   published by David Horowitz  s FrontPageMagazine.com.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  It  s perhaps worth nothing that the same webzine also published perhaps the most vitriolic antiMearsheimer and Walt piece to date  Abraham H. Miller  s  The New Protocols.   Miller begins by stating  Professors Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer  s recently disseminated antiSemitic screed has been ripped apart by both prominent scholars and literary figures showing it to be an intellectual fraud being passed off as serious scholarship.  The essay ends with  AntiSemites have now found the new  em  Protocols of the Elders of Zion  em  .    p    p  It didn  t really bother me much that such an article was published if the discussion was confined to the impersonal world of the Internet . I would write a detailed reply and circulate it among the people who read my stuff  and I knew that people who support my writing would rally to my defense and say nice things about me and my reply to Laksin . And I knew that I would get a few pieces of hate mail and maybe a couple of death threats  but that is to be expected . And it  s all rather abstract  since I basically sit in solitude at my computer and read it all  and it pretty much ends there . Frankly  there is a part of me that feels good about it  I hope that the word is getting out  even if by means of an attack piece.  p    p  The point is that when this article came out  almost all my anxiety stemmed from worries that the article would be picked up by people on my campus or in professional organizations in which I am involved . I wasn  t worried that I would lose my job  although Laksin was clearly upset about California State University  s  ignoring altogether the question of why it considers the manufacture of stylized bigotry an appropriate avocation for a tenured scholar.  What I dreaded was coming into my office and being greeted by cold shoulders and hostile stares  by colleagues not wanting to go to lunch or nervously looking away when I passed in the hall . I worried about reading sensationalistic articles in the campus newspaper.  p    p  I imagined going to academic conferences and receiving the same sort of reception . I worried that people wouldn  t invite me to write academic papers or wouldn  t cite my writing in other areas not related to Jewish issues.  p    p  This little bit of personal experience is doubtless typical of the forces of selfcensorship that maintain the political order of the postWorld War II West . It  s the concern about the facetoface consequences of being a nonconformist in the deeply sensitive areas related to race or to Jewish influence.  p    p  Consider the response of Anne Morrow Lindbergh to the torrent of abuse heaped upon her husband  Charles Lindbergh  for stating that Jews were one force promoting war against Germany in  . The speech threw her into  dark gloom    p    p  Will I be able to shop in New York at all now  I am always stared atbut now to be stared at with hate  to walk through aisles of hate    sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  Again  what is most feared is the personal  facetoface contact . As an evolutionary psychologist  it  s tempting to speculate that our evolved psychological mechanisms are triggered far more by the close and personal context of day to day interactions  not in the cold and impersonal world of communicating on the Internet.  p    p  And it  s not just that it is in the facetoface world of everyday life . It is that the areas of nonconformity we are talking about here have huge moral overtones . If one dissents from the reigning theory of macroeconomics or the main influences on th century French Romanticism  one may be viewed as a bit eccentric or perhaps ill informed . But one is not likely to be viewed as a moral reprobate . One is not likely to be subjected to torrents of moral outrage.  p    p  Evolutionary theorist Robert Trivers has proposed that the emotion of guilt is a sign to the group that a person will mend his ways and behave in the future  whereas shame functions as a display of submission to people higher in the dominance hierarchy . From that perspective  a person who is incapable of shame or guilt even for obvious transgressions is literally a sociopathsomeone who has no desire to fit into group norms . Such sociopathy would usually be a death sentence in the small groups that we humans evolved in . Only the most dominant individuals would be able to resist the moral outrage of the group  and even they must be concerned about coalitions rising against them.  p    p  What is striking  and perhaps counterintuitive  is that the guilt and shame remain even when we are completely satisfied at an intellectual level that our beliefs are based on good evidence and reasonable inferences . Anne Morrow Lindbergh writes   p    p  I can not explain my revulsion of feeling by logic . Is it my lack of courage to face the problem  Is it my lack of vision and seeing the thing through  Or is my intuition founded on something profound and valid  I do not know and am only very disturbed  which is upsetting for him . I have the greatest faith in him as a personin his integrity  his courage  and his essential goodness  fairness  and kindnesshis nobility really . . . . How then explain my profound feeling of grief about what he is doing  If what he said is the truth  and I am inclined to think it is   why was it wrong to state it    sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  Her reaction is involuntary and irrationalbeyond the reach of logical analysis . Charles Lindbergh was exactly right in what he said  but a rational understanding of the correctness of his analysis can not lessen the psychological trauma to his wife who must face the hostile stares of others . In psychological terms  the trauma is the result of implicit  unconscious processes stemming from our evolved psychology and a long history of successful socialization.  p    p  The preceding discusses the  push  of movements that have attempted to alter American and other Europeanderived societies into defenseless entities with no ethnic or cultural identity . But the other side of the equation must also be examinedthe traits that predispose Westerners to accept their own oblivion as a moral necessity . Here  Sunic emphasizes the heritage of Christian universalism and  especially in the case of America  the heritage of Puritan moralism.  p    p  Several writers have discussed the Puritan spirit  which combined of egalitarianism and democracy  religious hierarchy  and  sometimes violent  crusades against immorality.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  In the th century  Puritan areas had low levels of personal violence but the highest levels of  em  public  em  violence directed at heretics and those suspected of witchcraft . I have suggested that this emphasis on relative egalitarianism and consensual  democratic government are tendencies characteristic of Northern European peoples as a result of a prolonged evolutionary history as huntergatherers in cold  harsh environments.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  But the Puritans added a high degree of group cohesion  made possible by a powerful emphasis on cultural conformity  e.g.  punishment of religious heresy  and public regulation of personal behavior related to sex  fornication  adultery   public drunkenness  etc . One might say that the Puritans tried to square the circle by combining egalitarianism and democracyboth strongly associated with individualismwith high levels of cultural control  a collectivist trait.  p    p  But as Sunic emphasizes  it is the Puritan tendency to pursue utopian causes framed as moral issues that stands outtheir susceptibility to utopian appeals to a  higher law  and the belief that the principal purpose of government is moral . New England was the most fertile ground for  the perfectibility of man creed  and was the  father of a dozen  isms.    sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  There was a tendency to paint political alternatives as starkly contrasting moral imperatives  with one side portrayed as evil incarnateinspired by the devil . Puritan moral intensity can also be seen in their  profound personal piety   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  their intensity of commitment to live not only a holy life but also a sober and industrious life.  p    p  Puritans waged holy war on behalf of moral righteousness even against their own cousins . Whatever the political and economic complexities that led to the Civil War  it was the Yankee moral condemnation of slavery that inspired the rhetoric and rendered the massive carnage of closely related AngloAmericans  on behalf of slaves from Africa  justifiable in the minds of Puritans . Militarily . The war with the Confederacy rendered the heaviest sacrifice in lives and property ever made by Americans.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  This Puritan moral fervor  and its tendency to justify draconian punishment of  evildoers   can also be seen in the comments of the Congregationalist minister at Henry Ward Beecher  s Old Plymouth Church in New York  who called for  exterminating the German people . . . the sterilization of  German soldiers and the segregation of the woman.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  This Puritan moralism and its deep roots in America account for the importance of moral legitimacy in maintaining the current cultural regime . Anne Morrow Lindbergh  in expressing her thoughts on her husband  s controversial speech  related   p    p  I would prefer to see this country at war than shaken by violent antiSemitism .  Because it seems to me that the kind of person the human being is turned into when the instinct of Jewbaiting is let loose is worse than the kind of person he becomes on the battlefield .   p    p  In other words  the thought that even a disastrous war that might kill hundreds of thousands of Americans  and  as her husband believed  might result in the destruction of European culture and the White race  is preferable to the possibility of an outbreak of violent antiSemitism . For Puritansatheart like Mrs. Lindbergh  the moral demeanor of Americans is more important than their survival.  p    p  Elsewhere I have argued that this tendency toward moralistic punishment is a form of  altruistic punishment  described recently by research on group behavior in individualistic cultures.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  Because Europeans are individualists at heart  they readily rise up in moral anger against their own people once they are seen as morally blameworthya manifestation of their much stronger tendency toward altruistic punishment deriving from their evolutionary past as huntergatherers . But these tendencies are also present among Europeans  as the example from Sweden discussed above indicates.  p    p  Hence the current moralistic crusade of the Left so characteristic of contemporary Western civilization  Once Europeans were convinced that their own people were morally bankrupt  any and all means of punishment should be used against their own people . A major theme of The Culture of Critique is that the most influential intellectual and political movements of the th century presented European civilization as morally bankrupt and the proper target of moralistic punishment . Western culture had become the culture of guilt whose central icon had become the Holocaust and African slavery.  p    p  The forces maintaining the current cultural regime are multilayered . Because this culture of guilt has seized control of the pinnacles of moral and intellectual authority  resistance carries huge costs  which go far beyond practical considerations like keeping one  s job.The costs are also psychological and deeply personal.  p    p  But resistance does serve a function . As Sunic notes  there is a real prospect of social breakdown given the increasing ethnic divisions in the United States . In The Culture of Critique  I predicted that the current regime would lead to increased ethnic strife and an increased sense of group consciousness among European peoples . As an evolutionist  it is difficult for me to believe that a racial group would be unconcerned with its own eclipse and domination.  p    p  I believe that in the United States we are presently heading down a volatile patha path that leads to ethnic warfare and to the development of collectivist  authoritarian  and racialist enclaves . Although ethnocentric beliefs and behavior are viewed as morally and intellectually legitimate only among ethnic minorities . . . the development of greater ethnocentrism among Europeanderived peoples is a likely result of present trends . . . .  br   E  thnocentrism on the part of the Europeanderived majority in the United States is a likely outcome of the increasingly groupstructured contemporary social and political landscapelikely because evolved psychological mechanisms in humans appear to function by making ingroup and outgroup membership more salient in situations of groupbased resource competition . The effort to overcome these inclinations thus necessitates applying to Western societies a massive  therapeutic  intervention in which manifestations of majoritarian ethnocentrism are combated at several levels  but first and foremost by promoting the ideology that such manifestations are an indication of psychopathology and a cause for ostracism  shame  psychiatric intervention  and counseling . One may expect that as ethnic conflict continues to escalate in the United States  increasingly desperate attempts will be made to prop up the ideology of multiculturalism with sophisticated theories of the psychopathology of majority group ethnocentrism  as well as with the erection of police state controls on nonconforming thought and behavior.  p    p  At some point the negative consequences to the European population of the U.S. of multicultural ideology and massive influx of other peoples will become so obvious that current levels of control will be ineffective . We will be in a situation similar to that of the Soviet Union  when it became  in Sunic  s words   a makebelieve system nobody truly believed in and a state everybody  including former Communist party dignitaries  made fun of in private.  p    p  And if at this point  Europeans stare into the abyss and voluntarily cede political and cultural power  they will have no one to blame but themselves . And they will be cursed by their descendants . Perhaps they will one day read Tomislav Sunic  s excellent book and think about what might have been.  p    p   strong  KEVIN MACDONALD  strong  is Professor of Psychology at California State UniversityLong Beach .

No other statesman  not Washington  Jefferson  or Lincoln  is deemed worthy of a holiday all to his own . And no other national holiday seems to carry such relevant  pressing meaning for Americans as the third Monday in January . The th of July has become an excuse for a backyard barbecue . The MLK anniversary  on the other hand  inspires Americans to ask who we are and what our higher ideals should be.  p    p  Christmas developed in part from the Saturnalia which was held in Rome on roughly corresponding dates . The Saturnalia was  as it sounds  a celebration in honor of Saturn . One of  p    p  Christmas developed in part from the Saturnalia which was held in Rome on roughly corresponding dates . The Saturnalia was  as it sounds  a celebration in honor of Saturn . One of the most remarkable aspects of the festival manifested itself in the tradition of allowing slaves to rule over masters  at least symbolic.  p    p  Presumably this tradition was related to Saturn  s position vis√†vis a usurping Jupiter . To wit  during the Saturnalia  symbolically  Saturn  the Semitic slave  ruled Jupiter  the Aryan master . The festival was developed  in part  to honor a passed  Golden Age  when Saturn or  clearly  Jews or protoJews ruled.  p    p  That Christmas would develop in part from this tradition is wholly appropriate as both Christ and Saturn are manifestations of the Jewish God or Jewry embodied . But further  the winter in general was understood in the GrecoRoman world as belonging to Bacchus or Dionysus . To wit  it was a time of decadence  degeneracy  darkness and death . Bacchus  likewise  is an important manifestation of the Jewish God as this study explicates.  p    p  Here though  in the nadir of winter  the Winter solstice was also celebrated  signifying the beginning of a return to the spring and summer months . I argue that we  identifying with the solar  are obliged to be  em  above seasons  em   directing them . Hence  in my view  it is a symbolism of limited or dubious value  passive in its tone . For the moment  however  let  s focus on this figure of Saturn.  p    p  In Histories .  Tacitus writes  The Jews are said to have been refugees from the island of Crete who settled in the remotest corner of Libya in the days when  according to the story  Saturn was driven from his throne by the aggression of Jupiter.   p    p  Here  it should be clear to the modern reader  Saturn is being suggested as a personification of the Jewish people in much the way Judah or Yahweh may be understood as a personification of the Jewish people . Likewise  it should be our confident assertion that the expulsion comes at the hands of an Aryan faction personified in Jupiter . Jupiter represents the Aryan force that overthrows the Jewish power to establish a eugenic direction personified in his son Apollo . Hence  technically  it is we  who are Jupiter  while our secured  ameliorating descendants Apollo.  p    p  Regarding their Sabbath Tacitus writes   We are told that the seventh day was set aside for rest because this marked the end of their toilsOthers say that this is a mark of respect to Saturn  either because they owe the basic principles of their religion to the Idaei  who  we are told  were expelled in the company of Saturn and became the founders of the Jewish race  or because  among the seven stars that rule mankind  the one that describes the highest orbit and exerts the greatest influence is Saturn . A further argument is that most of the heavenly bodies complete their path and revolutions in multiples of seven.   a href   znysh       a   p    p  The name Idaei is derived from the name of Mount Ida  the highest mountain in Crete  around which the Idaei dwelt . This was a mountain sacred to the Titaness Rhea or Magna Mater  the sister and wife of Cronus or Saturn . Tacitus likewise relates the speculation that the name Judaei  from which Jew is derived  is  the barbarous lengthening of Idaei.   p    p  Likewise both the ancient Hellenes and the Hebrews would identify Saturn or Cronus with the Semitic El  one of the names used to describe the Jewish God in the Hebrew Bible . Hence  narratively  in the GrecoRoman cosmology  again  the usurpation of this earth god  Saturn  by a sky god  Jupiter  represents the restoration of an Aryan hegemony . To be clear  this does not mean that all of the Titans should be considered racially Semitic  only  to the extent they opposed Jupiter  Jewish dominated and controlled.  p    p  Thus when we understand the chief god of Carthage was Moloch  a href   etp       a  or Saturn  we understand this was an empire under Jewish control  yet perhaps not in all its parts Semitic . After all  for a long period  even if employing vast mercenary forces  it waged war effectively against Rome . Thus  doubtlessly  it retained some meaningful vestigial Aryan element capable of making war against a primarily Aryan Rome  practicing an essentially Aryan Religion.  p    p  Celestial Titans like the Sun Titian Helios  for example  a near Apollo equivalent  may be understood as descriptions of an undiluted or relatively undiluted Aryan remnant within a Judaized regime . Hence figures in the Olympian reign descended from these beings may likewise be understood as descending from undiluted or relatively undiluted Aryan blood . This is true so long as they are not usurping Gods.  p    p   a href   jzll       a  Tacitus   em  Histories  em  .  p    p   a href   fobte       a  Mythologist and archeologists speculate that Moloch  who the ancients identified with Saturn  was an early form of Yahweh . I will have the opportunity to argue that it is better to understand him as another aspect or  emanation  of the Jewish God persisting to this day.  p    p   Joyfully Amor seemed to me to hold my heart in his hand  and held in his arms my lady wrapped in a cloth sleeping .

The explosion of interest in this aspect of supposed AltRight  hate  is  in some sense  both understandable and predictable . Endlessly bewailing the racism of the AltRight in the context of ongoing White decline  mass immigration  and White cultural marginalisation has obvious rhetorical and evidential limits . To put it simply  nonWhites have never had it so good . Whether this fact will gradually bleed  racism  of energy as a galvanizing force for Leftism in the same way that an increase in material wealth among the working classes led to their abandonment by the Left by the s  remains to be seen . Certainly  most Marxists today appear to have abandoned the proletariat as the  privileged emancipatory subject   and have engaged in constructing new hegemonic  chains of equivalences.  This has involved championing  the feminist struggle    the struggle for freedom   and the  struggle for the rights of immigrants   all of which  they imagine  will one day coalesce in one big Struggle.  p    p  There can be little question  however  that  racism  has lost at least some of its shine . Blacks  in particular  appear to be somewhat marginalized by the focus of rhetoric on migrant caravans and amnesties . The Left  always seeking to find or create new victims  also seems particularly energized in recent years by sexual politics  or rather  the politicization of the sexual . Abortion  homosexual marriage  the  right  to AIDS medication  sexual harassment  real or image college rapes  and apparently unending issues of gender identity and orientation are unquestionably ubiquitous in contemporary politics and media . It therefore makes a great deal of tactical sense for the opponents of AltRight thought to attempt to drag the movement into this sphere  even if some of the core matters at issue are more or less peripheral to the central tenets of White identitarian politics.  p    p  One of the main flaws in these recent character assassinations targeting the movement is the blunt and facile method of attempting to interpret what is in fact a complex  varied  and nuanced understanding of relations between the sexes through historical time . This simplistic methodology begins with generalisations about the average male with AltRight political opinions . For example  neglecting the fact that grappling with the  Woman Question  has been a feature of Western civilisation from time immemorial  Pagans and Christians may choose Homer  s Helen or the Biblical Eve as they see fit   at least one apparently legitimate PhD has  a href  https  www.journals.uio.noindex.phpJEAarticleview    b  argued  b   a  that the origins of modern  misogyny  rest in Gamergate and the antics of chan . The only mitigating factor in this instance is probably that the PhD in question  an ethnic Sri Lankan named Udith Dematagoda  is unlikely to possess the requisite tools to appreciate and understand the trajectory of the female in Western history  art  culture  and politics . Less forgivable  perhaps  is Dematagoda  s gleeful but ignorant description of AltRight males as  maladjusted malcontents    peevishly dull obsessives who are prone to tantrums   and  nihilistically perverse basement dwelling jokers.   p    p   img alt   class  sizemedium wpimage aligncenter  height    sizes   maxwidth  px  vw  px  src  wpcontentuploadsDematagodaUdithHQx.jpg  srcset  wpcontentuploadsDematagodaUdithHQx.jpg w  wpcontentuploadsDematagodaUdithHQx.jpg w  wpcontentuploadsDematagodaUdithHQx.jpg w  width       p    p style  textalign  center     em   You  re all nihilistically perverse basement dwelling jokers.   em   p    p  The reality  of course  is that AltRight thought attracts attention and support from a broad crosssection of society  including men from varying professions  countries  socioeconomic positions  and educational backgrounds . But dealing comprehensively with the political and cultural opinions of such a group requires significantly more effort than would be the case with a  nihilistically perverse basement dwelling joker   and so the latter makes for a better straw man to beat with Leftist catchphrases . We are  of course  looking at much more than the reaction of bitter  single  young men to the dynamics of postmodern sexuality  and it  s therefore worthwhile more deeply considering the complexity of the issue of women  sex  and the AltRight . Since these issues did not  in fact  begin with chan  we should turn first to history.  p    p  The quasicannibalistic portion of Dante Alighieri  s opening  i  sonetto  i  from  i  La Vita Nuova  i   composed around    chosen to open this essay  set the tone for the entirety of the text and  also  in some respects for the trajectory of sexual relations in the West for centuries after . Regarded as a classic of literary chivalry or  courtly love    from whence we still derive the mocking term  White Knight   the poem narrates the love of Dante  in his youth  for Beatrice  a woman he loves  admires  and obsesses over from afar . This love is characterised in quite pronounced fashion as painful  hence the vision of the personification of love  Amor  literally feeding Dante  s beating and still warm heart to Beatrice . The conventions of literary courtly love typically follow the pattern of  Attraction to the lady  usually via eyesglance  Worship of the lady from afar  Declaration of passionate devotion  Virtuous rejection by the lady  Renewed wooing with oaths of virtue and eternal fealty  Moans of approaching death from unsatisfied desire  and other physical manifestations of lovesickness   Heroic deeds of valor which win the lady  s heart  Consummation of the secret love  Endless adventures and subterfuges avoiding detection.  p    p   i  La Vita Nuova  i  fulfils only some of these  but is still regarded as the preeminent example of the genre . Dante first sees Beatrice when they are both nine years old  and then a further nine years passes before he sees her again . In both instances he is utterly captivated by the sight of her . For most of the poem he is consumed with the worship of her from afar  but can never muster the composure to approach her directly . He finds himself enduring a number of manifestations of extreme lovesickness  including fainting and fevers . His nervous appearance is mocked by the friends of Beatrice  and then  at the height of Dante  s infatuation  Beatrice dies suddenly  sending him into a spiral of grief and  finally  slow recovery . In this recovery  he resurrects Beatrice as a spiritual ideal  and of course she features prominently in his next work   i  The Divine Comedy  i   where she quite literally guides him to Heaven . The intensity with which this relatively short and simple tale is recounted  along with novel stylistic devices  is one of the major reasons for its enduring position in high culture . In modern times  the tale was the subject of a number of magnificent late th century paintings by notorious womaniser Dante Gabriel Rossetti  as well as a short but remarkable operatic piece  Vide Cor Meum    See my Heart   by the Irish composer Patrick Cassidy that was subsequently in the score for the Ridley Scott films  i  Hannibal  i  and  i  Kingdom of Heaven  i  .  p    p  Dante  s  i  La Vita Nuova  i  marked  simultaneously  both a new departure from contemporary sexual conventions  and a return to older  primal attitudes regarding the female . Courtly love  according to most historians and literary scholars  was always rooted more in fiction than reality . It was a development fostered by poetaristocrats who sought to imbue certain chaste women  and relationships with them  with a metaphysical aura  often with religious or spiritual overtones . In doing so  the poetaristocrats in some sense returned to the old Roman pagan notion of  i  pudicitia  i   restraint or chastity  as contributing to the spiritual elevation of the female  i  .  i  A woman with a high degree of  i  pudicitia  i  typically sought to appear modest at all times and to limit her social interactions with men other than her husband and male relatives . Psychologist Neel Burton  a href  https  www.psychologytoday.comgbbloghideandseeklovesexandmarriageinancientrome    b  remarks  b   a  that   i  Pudicitia  i  stood for reason and control  whereas impudicitiathat is  shamelessness and sexual vice  struprum   sex crime   stood for chaos and disaster . A univira  oneman woman  was held in high esteem and even idealized  with the emperor Augustus   BC AD  going so far as to enact a programme of legislation to promote the notion and its observance.  Sex  women  order  and the divine were inextricable   p    p  The Romans sought to control female sexuality to protect the family and  by extension  social order  prosperity  and the state . They crystallized these notions in the cult of Venus  the mother of Aeneas  founder of Rome  and in the Vestal Virgins  the priestesses of the hearth goddess Vesta  who would be buried alive if convicted of fornication . To violate a Vestal Virgin  s vow of chastity was to commit an act of religious impurity  incestum   and thereby to undermine Rome  s compact with the gods  the pax deorum   peace of the gods   . Roman religion very much reflected and regulated sexual mores.  p    p   img alt   class  sizemedium wpimage aligncenter  height    sizes   maxwidth  px  vw  px  src  wpcontentuploadsdscfmidx.jpg  srcset  wpcontentuploadsdscfmidx.jpg w  wpcontentuploadsdscfmid.jpg w  width       p    p  The Roman ideal of the female  of course  coexisted with a tendency among some to debauchery . It also coexisted with a stoic  ultrarational view of sex and relationships bluntly exemplified in Marcus Aurelius  s observation that sex was nothing more than  the friction of a piece of gut and  following a sort of convulsion  the expulsion of some mucus.  Further  it drew upon the perennial  primordial  and quasimetaphysical position of the female body in the male mind . As Jonathan Bowden once remarked in his  a href  https  agkistrodonpiscivorus.wordpress.comjonathanbowdenontehgay    b  classic chastisement of movement homosexualists  b   a    p    p  A primal sexuality always embodies Heterosexuality . It alone relates to blood  genetics  racial causation and gender  s polarity . All culture springs from a child  s birth  it  s in accordance with Nature . A factor which necessitates the weakness of all alternatives  whether these are samesex  infantilistic or paedophile  bipolar  necrophile  coprophiliac  transgender or hermaphroditic  et cetera  All sexual beauty has to be female given the divinity of the woman  s body . Without it there  s nothing  in terms of Erotica  s stream of consciousness  When one considers threedimensional art  Rodin  s The Muse  Cybele or Aristide Malliol  s study for Action in Chains  one recognises the Anima at work . For representation of the female corpus is cardinal to mental creativity in many fields . In Hellenistic art  the Aphrodite of Melos  more commonly known as the Venus of Milo  glistens in its marble splendour in the Louvre . But even this doesn  t do justice to the subliminal eroticism given off by this work.  p    p  Schopenhauer  of course  famously attempted a rebuttal to such assertions in his essay  i  On Women  i   where he argued  p    p  Only a male intellect clouded by the sexual drive could call the stunted  narrowshouldered  broadhipped  and shortlegged sex the fair sex  for it is with this drive that all its beauty is bound up . More fittingly than the fair sex  women could be called the unaesthetic sex . Neither for music  nor poetry  nor the plastic arts do they possess any real feeling or receptivity.  p    p  The problems with Schopenhauer  s account include his criticism that concepts of beauty should be linked to the sexual drive  why shouldn  t it    which is of course primed to seek markers of fertility and genetic health . Schopenhauer  s implied markers of a concept of beauty  unclouded  by the sexual drive  longlimbed  broadshouldered  narrowhipped  are at best asexual and genetically counterpropositional . That such an injunction should arise from an essentially antilife philosopher who promoted suicide is probably not coincidental . His conflation of female physicality as muse and the female intellect as incapable of producing art is simply ridiculous  a sunset can not paint on canvas  but it can inspire countless canvasses  and we do not fear to call it beautiful . But perhaps the worst condemnation of Schopenhauer  s deconstructive approach to female beauty and the sexual drive was the blatant hypocrisy behind it . In his youth  the German philosopher was infatuated  in the style of Dante  with Karoline Jagemann  even writing her love poetry . He had a number of sexual affairs with  women of lower social status  such as servants  actresses  and sometimes even paid prostitutes   admitted to two children born outofwedlock  and confessed to at least one friend that he was often frustrated by a lack of sexual success with as great a number of women as he  d prefer . We might say that Schopenhauer  while correct in some of his assertions elsewhere in his essay  was personally caught in the tension between ideals and debauchery  between Dante and Tinder  and the result was a curious antifemale embitterment that in the end went beyond the rational and the reasonable.  p    p  Returning to  i  La Vita Nuova  i   the advent of courtly  and later romantic  love revisited existing tensions and contradictions regarding the female in the West  and also embellished the notion of the holy  chaste  yet erotic and captivating female . Crucially  however  the courtly love ideal also undermined the need for order that had been present in pagan Rome . The rise of Christianity led to the concept of order being taken to an absolute extreme  and to a medieval culture in which marital sex was viewed as a concession  not as a right or even a gift from God . Sex and relationships were therefore scheduled to ensure the most possible procreation and the least possible pleasure . Even children conceived during a period where the couple should have abstained  mainly based on the liturgical calendar and the wife  s reproductive cycle  were considered bastards . Ironically  Dante and the courtly poets overcame this mechanistic approach to love and sex in order to elevate sexuality itself to an ideal  but in doing so paved the very path for its decline and degradation . Schultz observes   p    p  In the history of European thinking on these matters  the gradual shift from an ideology of sex for procreation to an ideology of sex for pleasure is one of the most important longterm developments . Courtly love represents an important milestone in that shift  a secular ruling class advances an ideal of amorous relations in which making love requires no justification other than the joy and high spirits it brings the persons involved . The desire for children is not required to excuse the lovers  pleasures . Indeed  they never think of procreation and no one expects them to do so . The institution of marriage  whether sacred or secular  is not necessary to legitimize their embraces . The joy and high spirits that lovers feel when they make love are all the justification needed.  p    p   James A. Schultz   i  Courtly Love  the love of Courtliness  and the History of Sexuality  i   Chicago  University of Chicago Press        p    p  The notion of a culture that promotes and idealizes the female while simultaneously paving the path for her decline and degradation should sound very familiar  and the reason for this is that the  Woman Question   such as it exists  has been unresolved and is likely to remain so . What really marks the difference between our own era and prior ages is the abandonment of any need of a rationale for a metaphysical elevation of the female  and the wholesale expansion and embracing of the  courtly  literary fiction of  love for love  s sake  which has led to a proliferation of promiscuity and  in turn  the commonplace acceptance of homosexuality . Expressed in simple terms  today there are no criteria for a woman to be considered special  modesty or  i  pudicitia  i    all women are assumed to be metaphysically important and fundamentally special  regardless of background or how many previous  loves  they have cycled through.  p    p  Much of contemporary sexual politics has two lives  the lived reality and the reported fiction . Mainstream media accounts of modern sex and sexuality perpetuate the relatively unsophisticated doxa of a  crisis in masculinity.  This phrasing is deceptive because it implies that the increasingly degraded state of Western sexuality is really only bad for men  and that if men would just accept the fall of patriarchy we  d all be much happier . We can  of course  concede that certain significant aspects of the postmodern sociocultural context are extremely bad for men . The divorce system is bad for men . The child custody system is bad for men . The sexual habits of women in postmodernity are bad for a lot of men  though it must be conceded they benefit a minority of men seeking shortterm sexual gratification  . We can see the results in the shocking suicide statistics among males  and the increasingly poor performance of young males at school . There is undoubtedly a crisis among males . But whether the degraded state of Western sexuality  in a broader sense  affects males so exclusively that the terminology of a  crisis in masculinity  is appropriate as an overarching explanation of modern sexual politics is less clear . The crisis may in fact be said to embrace men and women equally  and modern sexuality as a whole  because the disease is essentially systemic in the feministic foundations of postmodern liberalism  even if the mass media is simultaneously convincing women  often barely  that they are liberated  free  successful  satisfied  and fulfilling a greater destiny than motherhood and the domestic setting might offer them.  p    p   img alt   class  sizemedium wpimage aligncenter  height    sizes   maxwidth  px  vw  px  src  wpcontentuploadsdrunkbx.jpg  srcset  wpcontentuploadsdrunkbx.jpg w  wpcontentuploadsdrunkb.jpg w  width       p    p  All factual indicators prove that women have  liberated  themselves into despair .

One  a href  https  uk.businessinsider.comwhyamericanmenaregettinglessmarriageable  rUS  amp  IRT    b  study  b   a  found that  when towns and counties lose manufacturing jobs  fertility and marriage rates among young adults go down  too .

Meanwhile  places with  i  higher  i  manufacturing employment have a bigger wage gap between men and women  and a higher marriage rate.  A problem arises when feminism convinces women they should seek highwage employment while their instincts convince them to always  marry up  for resources  even if this scenario radically reduces their pool of potential mates . Because these women are  a href  https  financialuproar.comwhydowomenrefusetomarrydown    b  refusing  b   a  to  marry down   they are more or less condemned to being the shortterm sexual entertainment of a small number of very wealthy men and  ultimately  to die childless .

This is the liberated female of postmodernity  stripped of  i  pudicitia.  i   p    p  Postmodernity has also stripped the female of the erotic mystery of metaphysical quality that has featured so heavily in her historical trajectory . We have moved  as it were  from Dante to Tinder . As Roger Scruton has observed  the saturation of culture with the  i  sexual  i  has bleached it of metaphysical speculation and genuinely  i  erotic  i  potential . The same enthralling female form that inspired Rodin  s The Muse or Aristide Malliol  s study for Action in Chains has been demystified and crudely embarrassed by the rutting baseness of ubiquitous pornography  the primary object of which is not to raise the female bodily form to spiritual heights but rather to subjugate and debase it . The Irish comedian Dara O  Brien once remarked that he couldn  t watch pornography primarily because it seemed  full of angry people   a telling commentary on a cultural product that is probably as much about venting frustrations on women  and seeing them punished after a fashion  as personal sexual titillation.  p    p  Since  as Roger Scruton argues in  i  Sexual Desire  A Philosophical Investigation  i      sexual mystery is an important component of normal heterosexual relations  the stripping of sexuality of this component  along with cultural negation of differences in the sexes  lends it qualities normally associated with the homosexual  promiscuity  indifference to the other  narcissism  and predation.  p    p   img alt   class  sizemedium wpimage aligncenter  height    sizes   maxwidth  px  vw  px  src  wpcontentuploadsmaxresdefaultx.jpg  srcset  wpcontentuploadsmaxresdefaultx.jpg w  wpcontentuploadsmaxresdefaultx.jpg w  wpcontentuploadsmaxresdefaultx.jpg w  wpcontentuploadsmaxresdefault.jpg w  width       p    p  Scruton  who deemed homosexuality a perversion from a moral philosophical standpoint  remarks on the necessary inherent tension and complementarity of heterosexual relations   Male desire evokes the loyalty which neutralises its vagrant impulse  female desire evokes the conquering urge which overcomes its hesitations.  Damage to the heterosexual features of loyalty and hesitation  most notably in the case of culturally sanctioned or promoted promiscuity  eventually lead to a collapse of cultural tension and eroticism in the sphere of the sexual . Scruton calls this the  decline in the sentiment of sex.   p    p  One of the fundamental problems in postmodern sexuality is that women lay claim to all the privileges  respect  and admiration associated in earlier eras with  i  pudicitia  i  without fulfilling its requirements or contributing to social order  and often in fact undermining it  . We witness a proliferation of scenarios in which a Stormy Daniels lays claim to being treated as a Beatrice . But the days of forlornly admiring a demure beauty from afar are surely gone  cheaply replaced by gazing at the pouting  photoshopped visage of a common trollop advertising her wares on a dating app  no longer soliciting love poems and feverish protestations of undying love  but now a succession of repetitive chatup lines and  dick pics.  Women  or I suppose lovers of both sexes in general  are no longer experienced by each other  but consumed  with all the attending eventual and inevitable obsolescence the latter term implies . This begs the question as to the role of women in an increasingly barren  infertile culture saturated with intercourse   the friction of a piece of gut and  following a sort of convulsion  the expulsion of some mucus   but devoid of the sentiment of sex.  p    p  The AltRight  s grappling with this question has provoked the aforementioned accusations of misogyny  based on the erroneous  and often duplicitous  assumption that the crisis in modern sexuality is merely the problem of a handful of frustrated basementdwellers unable to secure a girlfriend   a crisis in masculinity  experienced only by the  sexually unsuccessful.  But  as has been discussed  the postmodern West as a whole is sexually unsuccessful  being more neurotic than erotic  and inducing the sexes to hate each other while producing STDs faster than it produces children . The grappling of the AltRight  the manosphere  and similar tributaries of thought have resulted variously in support for MGTOW  Men Going Their Own Way   the bitter repudiations of the Incels  semiironic calls for  White Sharia   and  at the more moderate end  a call for the return to more traditional gender roles and the  for lack of a better term   redomestication  of the Western woman . These strands of thought have all been denounced as expressions of hatred of women when  in fact  they are the expression  with greater or lesser success  of the desire to make women loveable  admirable  cherishable  even metaphysical again . It is a desire  if not to move from Tinder back to Dante  then to at least return to a period in which an almost spiritual respect for  i  pudicitia  i  lifted the female beyond the bitter descriptions of Schopenhauer.  p    p  This desire is often the case even despite the most superficially antiwoman phrasing of these various movements because  at heart  their stated goals involve restoring Woman to a state in which she was in fact admired in such a fashion . MGTOW is not so much a statement of hatred of the female as an admission that the man going his own way finds it impossible to love and commit to Woman  i  in her present state and in the current culture  i  . Pickup artistry is merely the nihilistic response to Woman  i  in her present state and in the current culture  i   in which the male concedes that the sentiment of sex is gone  and with it the prospect of meaningful marriage and family  but seeks to reap as much intercourse as can be obtained from the debauched and demystified females of postmodernity . The Incels acknowledge bitterly the fact they are the prime casualties of Woman  i  in her present state and in the current culture  i   enduring sexual disenfranchisement as a consequence of the decline of monogamy and the economic impact of feminism . The advocates for  White Sharia   and increased control over the behavior of women  are disillusioned by Woman  i  in her present state and in the current culture  i   and are merely seeking the most radical form of reversal . Those seeking the  redomestication  of the female are similarly disappointed with the position of Woman  i  in her present state and in the current culture  i   and believe in the promotion of family values and wifely attributes as a corrective . Whether through gentle inducement or strict control  all groups are essentially unanimous in seeking the reinstatement of  i  pudicitia  i  in the life of Western women.  p    p  The actual feasibility of such schemes  even in the most extreme case  evades clarity . The demystification of Woman  such as has been witnessed over the last century  is unprecedented in the history of our culture . It may in fact be the case that feminism has brought the Western female to her lowest level of esteem among her male peers than at any time in history . Reversing this process  going from Tinder to Dante  seems nigh impossible . What has been seen  as they say  can not be unseen . Any process of  remystification  in order to revive the sentiment of sex would almost certainly take generations to achieve  and would at the very least require the reintroduction of social controls concerning promiscuity  the elevation of  i  pudicitia  i  and marriage  i   i  to a place of high sociocultural esteem  the strict regulation or abolition of pornography as an industry  the remarginalization of homosexuality and the banning of homosexual marriages of all kinds  an end to abortion on demand  and  finally  the cultural celebration of essential gender  i  differences  i  .  p    p  Nietzsche  the JudeoChristian Legacy  and European Unification Note I first wrote this essay in the winter of   as part of my graduate study at Duke University .

Much honing has taken place  for clarity  flow  and depth  but the structure is unchanged.  p    p  I had first encountered Nietzsche  s writings in the year  in my extracurricular readings while an undergraduate at the University of Virginia . Reading him marked a turning point in my life  indeed  I find it hard to imagine what my approach to thinking about society  politics  and religion would be without Nietzsche as educator . Writing isn  t just a form of communication  but a process of discovery for the author . Composing this essay some  years ago  I was moving beyond a raw  youthful understanding of Nietzsche  s critiques of Christian morality  democracy  and the modern age  and towards his deeper  in many ways   em  hidden  em  vision for the transformation of the world . Everybody knows that Nietzsche said  God is dead   few recognize  em  why  em  and  em  how  em  this catastrophe occurred  what the consequences will be  and how European man can overcome this event.  p    p  This essay is about politics . Nietzsche  of course  never put forth any straightforward  political program   though his works are littered with sharp opinions on the passing scene . He does  however  develop a  em  metapolitics  em  . This is not  political science  in the sense that it is used today  but politics understood from the standpoint of the transcendent . It is the European crisisthe end game of the JudeoChristian legacy  the death of Godthat births the  good Europeans  and  artist tyrants  who  Nietzsche expects  will rule the continent  p    p  Revisiting this essay now  it strikes me as unfinished .

The fact that Nietzsche chose to image Romeand specifically  em  not  em  Athensin what is ultimately a kind of  political testament  goes against much that is taken for granted in Nietzsche scholarship.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  There is  of course  good reason for this . In Nietzsche first book   em  The Birth of Tragedy  em      he posited the tragic age of Aeschylus and Sophocles as the unreachable standard of cultural achievement . Even if he later came to view many of his claims in this volume as  embarrassing   BT P      it seems reasonable to assume that Athens remained for him a political icon.  p    p  Nietzsche  s most important writings on Greek culture came at a point in his life when he was most overtly politically engaged  and his attitude towards thcentury Athens should be understood within that context .  em  The Birth of Tragedy  em  was written in the wake of German national unification  which occurred months before its publication . And at this time  Nietzsche was  effectively  a German nationalist  he distanced himself from militarism and was critical of the state  but he was a nationalist nonetheless . Nietzsche imaged Germany  s rise to greatness not only through military victory over the French but through a revived cultural spirit . He  in  famously claimed    F  or it is only as an  em  aesthetic phenomenon  em  that existence and the world are eternally  em  justified  em    BT    and for him  the political achievements of both thcentury Athens and thcentury Germany would be measured though their cultural output . In this line  it was Kant and Schopenhauer who were  in Nietzsche  s eyes  courageous enough to  critique reason   to adumbrated aspects of existence outside Socratean rationality . They thereby introduced  an infinitely profounder and more serious view of ethical problems and art which we may designate as Dionysian wisdom comprised in concepts   BT   . They were  in this way  able to approach the tragic wisdom of Aeschylus . This new  em  Weltanschauung  em  would find expression in Wagner  s musicdramasthe combination of the Apollonian heroic outlook with Dionysian  infinite melody  to be performed publicly at the annual Bayreuth festival.  p    p  On all levels  Nietzsche understood this new cultural project to be ethnonationalist in character   p    p   W  e have the feeling that the birth of a tragic age simply means a return to itself of the German spirit  a blessed rediscovery after powerful intrusive influences had for a long time compelled it . . . being attached to the lead strings of a  em  Romanic civilization  em   BT   emphasis added   .  p    p  Anticipating the deification of German  em  Kultur  em  at the expense of Western  French  em  Zivilization  em  in the s and  s  Nietzsche here imagines the triumph of the German spirit as specifically  em  antiimperial  em  in character  it would be a great throwing off of the legacy of Rome  Christianity  and the supraethnic  supranational institutions that had defined  Europe  for two millennia.  p    p  By Nietzsche  s middle and late periods  much had changed . Far from being an ethnonationalist  Nietzsche filled these writings with numerous barbs and insults against all things German . In terms of philosophy and culture  Nietzsche claims that the  origin of the German Spirit  is not Kant and Schopenhauer but beerguzzling and  distressed intestines   EH II    . Wagner and Bayreuth become an expression of decadencean opera festival for philistines and the  em  nouveau riche  em   not a rebirth of tragedy . Politically  he came to reject unequivocally Bismarck  Wilhelm I  and the Reich . In turn  Nietzsche  s stance towards the Greeks also changed . Although a deep admiration never waned  Athenian culture no longer served as a touchstone and cultural model in these writings . By his final productive years  Nietzsche had become almost disenchanted  with the exception of Thucydides  Nietzsche reports to have lost interest in the literature of ancient Athens . Historical models were dramatically redefined    The Greeks   em  can not  em  mean as much to us as the Romans   TI X    . On one level  Nietzsche  s turn from Athens  and Bayreuth  to Rome is indicative of an interest in moving beyond the  em  polis  em  and  em  ethnos  em   the two most fundamental concepts of Greek politics and cultural identity  in favor of imperial hegemony and a synthesis of European ethnicities . In a way  Nietzsche  s imperialism can be seen as an outgrowth of his earlier cultural nationalism  dreams of German unification were morphing into dreams of a German empire.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup   p    p  On another level  Nietzsche  s transformation marks a move from art to politicsor rather a view that politics was the grandest genre of art of them all . A culture can not be justified solely by culture  whether Attic Tragedy or Wagnerian musicdrama  instead  Nietzsche begins to view culture as arising in the shadow of the state . The state itself becomes the centerpiece of all cultural  social  and intellectual development . Nietzsche remarks that  the grand style  that is  the imperial political structureis  no longer mere art but  has  become reality  truth   em  life  em    AC    . Not Athens . . . not Bayreuth . . . but Rome.  p    p  It is not difficult to cull sundry political opinions from out Nietzsche  s texts and discover what he thought about public intellectuals like David Strauss and Heinrich von Treitschke  not to mention Bismarck and the Kaiser . But then Nietzsche famously called himself the  last  em  antipolitical  em  German   EH I     and he did not formulate anything resembling a political program or  pragmatic  agenda . Reconstructing such things risks wishful thinking or forgery . Where Nietzsche does sustain a discussion of politics  his  political philosophy  is often grandiose bordering on the fantastical . Unconcerned with the vagaries of parliamentary majorities or policyanalysis  Nietzsche instead focused on  Cesare Borgia as Pope  and the creation of a new aristocracy . At other times  when Nietzsche discusses politics  he seems to actually be concerned with something else . As Tracy Strong observes   The one attempt Nietzsche makes at providing a unified perspective  em  explicitly  em  on politics . . . to our confusion  is essentially a discussion of music   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  . Still  as the above discussion of Athens and Rome reveals  politics are extremely important to Nietzsche and inform  if always subtly  his wider philosophy.  p    p  Throughout the th century  interpretations of Nietzsche  s political thought have  generally speaking  shifted between two poles and  . First  there is the Nietzsche of  will to power    the overman    the blond beast    the antiChrist   a thinker who is an opponent of democracy  the herd  and modernity itself.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  But on the other hand  there is the Nietzsche of immoralism  selfcreation   life as a work of art   a thinker who becomes the forefather of Foucault  Derrida  and much of the postmodern Left.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  Both of these political interpretations seem equally right and wrong . The main problem is that associating Nietzsche with political movements with which he was never involved blocks consideration of his political philosophy on its own terms . Not coincidentally  these kinds of interpretations have also blocked serious consideration of what Nietzsche explicitlythough always ellipticallyclaims to be the  politics of the future  Europeanism.  p    p  By   Nietzsche was already speaking of himself and his equals as   em  good Europeans  em   Europe  s heirs  the rich superabundant  but also abundantly obligated heirs of two millennia of the European spirit   GS V    .  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  A year earlier  his disenchantment with nationalism was explicit and he had already formulated the basis of a supranational project   p    p  Owing to the pathological estrangement which the insanity of nationality has induced  and still induces  among the peoples of Europe  owing also to the shortsightedness and quickhanded politicians who are at the top today with the help of this insanity  without any inkling that their separatist policies can of necessity only be  em  entr  acte  em  policies  owing to all this and much else that today simply can not be said  the most unequivocal portents are now being overlooked  or arbitrarily and mendaciously reinterpretedthat  em  Europe wants to become one  em  .  BGE VIII     p    p  German ethnonationalism was expunged from Nietzsche  s consciousness . While in  em  The Birth of Tragedy  em   he speaks of German particularism breaking out from under the  servitude  of  Romanic Civilization   by his mature period  he stresses the need for a new supranational order . Nietzsche discounts ethnicity and goes as far as to imagine the possibilities  and dangers  of a  new synthesis  the mixing of the European races . During the writing of  em  The Birth of Tragedy  em   Nietzsche was a prominent member of the ideologically antiSemitic  Bayreuth Circle  surrounding Richard Wagner  though it is not clear that Nietzsche ever shared all of their views  . After his break  Nietzsche began to praise the Jews a ripe for the  mastery over Europe  and as powerful precisely through their  nomadic   international culture  BGE VIII      .  p    p  But even if it is uncontroversial that in Nietzsche  s mature thought he embraced a kind of Europeanism  the question remains of exactly  em  why  em  . Without doubt  Nietzsche did not support  Europe  and reject ethnonationalism and antiSemitismout of a sense of  liberalism    tolerance   or  multiculturalism.  To the contrary  Nietzsche wanted the opposite of these things and even described the potential leaders of Europe as  tyrants   BGE VIII    . Nietzsche was first and foremost a philosopher  and he adopted a political philosophy out of philosophic necessity .  Politics in the grand style  did not emerge from an ideology  at least in the simplistic sense of the term  nor from blind pragmatism . Instead  as I hope to demonstrate  Nietzsche forges his politics in the realm of the transcendental  as a response to a cultural and spiritual crisis on the continenta crisis that affects not only politics but theology  epistemology  and aesthetics.  p    p  In  em  Ecce Homo  em      Nietzsche mentions that his mother  Franziska Oehler  married his father in Eilenburg in   the  great war year  in which Napoleon entered the city . Nietzsche relates that   As a Saxon  she was a great admirer of Napoleon  it could be that I still am  too   EH I    . It is certainly not a stretch to say that the  em  empereur  em  and his attempted unification of Europe represent for Nietzsche a manifestation of the imperial politics he most admired  and  in many ways  Nietzsche  s view of Napoleon encapsulates the way  great politics  functions within his philosophy . It is important to note that Nietzsche  s esteem for Napoleon should not be viewed as mere  hero worship  or as an example of  Great Man history.  Nietzsche never admired Napoleon for his skill in getting to the top  that is  for his  will to power  in the most individualistic and simplistic of meanings . Napoleon instead represents for Nietzsche a culmination of cultural energies   The history of Napoleon  s reception is almost the history of the highest happiness attained by the whole century in its most valuable human beings and moments  BGE V    . As the French Revolution inaugurated the zenith of democratic leveling  and popular  em  ressentiment  em    Nietzsche viewed Napoleon as a kind of  signpost to the  em  other  em  path   that of the great and terrible aristocracy of antiquity and the Italian Renaissance . Napoleon was not important for Nietzsche as a  French patriot  and less so as a great individual  he held meaning as a realization of the spirit  Napoleon was  the problem of the  em  noble ideal as such  em  made flesh . . . the synthesis of the  em  inhuman  em  and the  em  superhuman  em   GM I    .  p    p  Just as Napoleon embodied a cultural problem  Nietzsche formulates his definition of  great politics  around what he perceives as a Europeanwide spiritual and cultural crisis . In describing  why I am a destiny   Nietzsche imagines  politics in the grand style  as encompassing both the terrible truth that Nietzsche  s philosophy announces to the world and the  war of spirits  that must follow   p    p  For when truth enters into a fight with the lies of millennia  we shall have upheavals  a convulsion of earthquakes  a moving of mountains and valleys  the like of which has never been dreamed of . The concept of politics will have merged entirely with a war of spirits  all power structures of the old society will have been explodedall of them are based on lies  there will be wars the like of which have never yet been seen on earth . It is only beginning with me that the earth knows  em  great politics  em  .  EC IV     p    p  This is a particularly pregnant passage  and it is related to a number of concerns of this essay . For now  it is important to recognize that Nietzsche views  great politics  as emerging directly from a crisis of his age . In announcing the demise of the basic structures of European society  Nietzsche sees himself as unleashing  great politics   a kind of combination of actual war and a contestation of value.  p    p  What Nietzsche views as comprising his  truth  against  the lies of millennia  is  at its core  his announcement that  God is dead.   p    p  Those who only know one thing about Nietzsche usually know the halftruth that he loathed Christianity and was a militant atheist . While it is true that Nietzsche did present himself as  the Antichrist   to say that Nietzsche was writing polemically  em  against  em  Christianitylike some protoChristopher Hitchensis to misconstrue him entirely . Nietzsche hardly thought that the Europeans of the futureperhaps led by a few  overmen  who had read  em  Thus Spoke Zarathustra  em  could recognize the faults of Christianity and then simply  get rid of it.  To think so is to vastly underestimate the complexityand  indeed  the  em  ambivalence  em  of Nietzsche  s critique . Nietzsche did not view JudeoChristianity  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  and its legacy as mere  lies  as the  opium of the masses  in Marx  s language or the  God Delusion   to borrow a phrase from the selfstyled  New Atheists.  He viewed Christianity much like a traditional conservativeas the most basic grounding of what has come to be called  The West.  To actually oppose JudeoChristianityas Nietzsche imagines himself as doing in the passage from  em  Ecce Homo  em  is not only to risk catastrophe but also all assurance of a future . As I will demonstrate below  Nietzsche questioned the very ability of Europeans to think outside the confines of the JudeoChristian tradition . Simply exiting Christianity  or transcendent thinking in general  was not an option.  p    p  Europeans had not simply  lost faith.  God is dead because the  the belief in the Christian God has become unbelievable   GS V    . Put into other words  the Human and Natural Sciences   Enlightenment  in the broadest sense  pursued its  will to know  to the point that it shattered the religious basis of European societies . What remains most important about this conception is that Nietzsche specifically does not view Enlightenment and the  will to know  as emerging from a system of knowledge and values outside or alien to JudeoChristianity . Nietzsche would never deny that the Sciences were often set opposed to the Church  and viceversa   however  for him  the  will to know  lies at the center of the JudeoChristian tradition.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  Moreover  as I will discuss below   truth  functions within JudeoChristianity in a way that differs in prominence and quality from other historical religions.  p    p  In this line  Nietzsche  s supranationalismhis Europeanismis directly linked to his expansive view of the influence of JudeoChristianity . It is specifically Europe  s struggle with its Christian legacy that generates  great politics  and the need for a radical transformation . Nietzsche claims that the JudeoChristian tradition has  created in Europe a magnificent tension of the spirit the like of which had never yet existed on earth  with so tense a bow we can now shoot for the most distant goals   BGE P  . It is this  tension  Europe  s turning against itselfthat can launch it into greater heights.  p    p  But even if JudeoChristianity  s tension with the Enlightenment generates the European crisis  Nietzsche does not believe in the least that Enlightened politicsspecifically nationalism  democracy  and liberalismare well suited to address the problem . For Nietzsche  when a culture is in crisis  it must turn to  the grand style  in order to  unbend the bow.  Nietzsche seeks to construct a new kind of aristocratic politics that would not simply be  antiChristian  but mark a transformation of the tradition . The  good Europeans  the new masters and tyrants of the continentwill rise to power  not in polemical opposition to JudeoChristianity  but by embodying the productive contradictions and antagonisms of its legacy.  p    p  Few thinkers have been as selfconsciously hostile towards their age and milieu as Nietzsche . Fewer still have felt themselves to be so out of place  to have been literally born at the wrong time . In  em  Ecce Homo  em   Nietzsche presents himself as an  em  epigone  em   as the  presumably last   disciple of the god Dionysius.  This contrasts sharply with the  em  forward  em  orientation in many of his other writings in which he claims to be a John the Baptist of  the philosophy of the future.  Perhaps Nietzsche is most honest when he critically admits that he is a product of his own age   I am a decadent   EH I    .  p    p  Without doubt  Nietzsche  s profound alienation from late thcentury European culture had many personal causes  his various health problems  rejection by his peers  and the absence of adequate companionship being but a few . But far more importantly  Nietzsche  s particular animus towards European society resulted from the fact that he felt he knew his age  em  all too well  em  . More specifically  he believed himself to be fully aware of a cultural crisis beyond comparison  the consequences and implications of which would change utterly all facets of Europe . Being born both too early and too late  Nietzsche saw himself  stretched in the contradiction between today and tomorrow   GS V    . As Cassandra  he foresees the coming catastrophe  as John the Baptist  he glimpse a new dawn.  p    p  An exact and concise description of the European crisis is difficult to put into words simply because Nietzsche develops this theme in a wide variety of manifestations . For the purpose of this essay  it is useful to look at a particularly poignant image of the crisis from the middle of Nietzsche  s careerhis announcement of the  death of God  and the formation of  shadows over Europe   GS V    .  p    p  It is of great importance to understand that Nietzsche  s famous announcement that God is dead is actually far more  em  anthropological  em  and  em  phenomenological  em  than it is theological . In Werner Dannhauser  s words  Nietzsche practices  historical atheism    The saying that God is dead implies that God once existed . God existed while one could believe in God  God is dead because belief in God has become impossible.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  The vital questions thus become   em  Why did God die   em  and  em  Who killed him   em  Nietzsche  s full formulation is that  God is dead . God remains dead . And  em  we  em  have killed him  emphasis added    GS    . We killed him not simply through our loss of faith  for fervency comes and goes and can be lost and regained . Saying  scientists  or  atheists  killed God is equally unsatisfactory  for science as mere technical mastery does not touch the soul . God died over the course of the series of tumults that cut off European man from the transcendent . Copernicus removed him from the center of the cosmos . . . Galileo discovered that natural laws hold in the celestial spheres just as much as they do on Earth . . . Darwin demonstrated that man emerged from out of brutality and death . . . Individuals and specific discoveries are not important  as no single person killed God . And Nietzsche does not posit an aggressive  atheism  as a motivating factor  to the contrary  the scientists mentioned above were inspired by Christian faith . But to go on believing in the Christian God in the face of the modern experience was  for Nietzsche  a sign of childishness  denial  and cowardice . Nietzsche does not view natural  Enlightenment  as the highest form of wisdom  but he never underestimated its immense  catastrophic power.  p    p  Though the bad news has not yet been heeded by all  Nietzsche  and a select few  grasp that the death of the Christian God will be followed by the collapse of  the whole of our European morality.  Furthermore  the end of faith will instigate a  sequences of breakdown   culminating in the destruction of the institutions and values based upon the JudeoChristian moral system . The th century will witness nothing less than the eclipse of the sun.  p    p  In making such claims  Nietzsche might seem to have much in common with the pessimism of many conservatives of the late th century  and today   who viewed the end of faith as equally disastrous  and sometimes in equally grandiose terms . Yet Nietzsche  s perspective on the death of God is wholly different than that of such figures . Firstly  Nietzsche viewed the coming catastrophe as necessary  even if all of Europe does not yet recognize it  there is no hope for a Christian revival  for such a thing would inherently ring hollow . Nietzsche would not have been surprised by the decent of mainstream Christianity into selfesteem doctrines or community organizing.  p    p  Secondly  while the death of God is a disaster  Nietzsche sees it as containing great potential benefit . As stressed by Michael Allen Gillespie  what Nietzsche most opposed in Christianity is that it leads Europeans into believing that  after the collapse of Christian morality  life in general would have no meaning . But Nietzsche instead envisioned other types of men who  although disturbed by the death of God  accept the dilemma and learn to view it as an opportunity for a cultural transformation.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  In this line  Nietzsche  s tone in this aphorism moves from despairing to rhapsodic . The  shadows over Europe  lift to reveal a  new dawn   and Nietzsche shifts to a new set of metaphors  imaging the  death of God  as a starting point for great new voyages of the spirit . Writing as one of the  free spirits  who understands the positive aspect of the collapse  Nietzsche ironically entitles Aphorism   The Meaning of our Cheerfulness.   p    p  Such passages deserve serious criticism on many levels.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  First and foremost  as pointed out by Gillespie  one might counter that Nietzsche vastly overrated the degree to which the European world would sink into suicidal  nihilistic despair . Although the years  might seem a fulfillment of Nietzsche  s prophecy   If the intervening years have proven anything  it is that bourgeois society can weather the death of God without collapsing into either passive or active nihilism.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  But for the purpose of this essay  it is of greatest importance to stress that Aphorism  only represents one aspect of Nietzsche  s conception of the European crisis  and by no means does it express the great complexities and ironies surrounding the death of God . Indeed  as Nietzsche begins Book V of  em  The Gay Science  em  with an apocalyptic vision  he follows it immediately with Aphorism  in which he stresses the longterm continuity of JudeoChristian culture . While  The Meaning of our Cheerfulness  images a  new dawn   Nietzsche juxtaposes it with an aphorism that reminds one of the presence of the past . Nietzsche approaches this recognition of the  em  long dur√©  em  of culture through a discourse on epistemology.  p    p  In Aphorism    How we  too  are still Pious   Nietzsche first observes that the  scientific spirit  of rational inquiry is one of testing and scrutinizing established convictions  for example   does a heavier body actually fall faster than a lighter one   Science is ultimately a process in which  convictions  are destroyed  those that crumble under scrutiny are discarded  and those that hold are no longer mere convictions but  knowledge  and  truth.  In describing this spirit  Nietzsche  no doubt  has in mind Descartes objective in his  em  Meditations on First Philosophy  em     to bring into question every single idea  perception  and premise in order to arrive at a firm ground for knowledge . This is certainly not anything that Nietzsche takes lightly  far from being an  irrationalist   Nietzsche views the breaking down of conviction as the heart of any great philosophy   p    p   G  reat spirits are skeptics . Zarathustra is a skeptic . Strength   em  freedom  em  which is born of the strength and overstrength of the spirit  proves itself by skepticism . Men of convictions are not worthy of the least consideration in fundamental questions of value and disvalue . Convictions are prisons   AC   .  p    p  But if science strives to knock down convictions  Nietzsche discerns a deeper  unspoken  em  conviction  em  undergirding the entire enterprise  it is one that is so pervasive and indispensable to science as a system that it can never be confronted directly   We see that science also rests on a faith   GS V    .  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  This conviction is that  truth has value.   p    p  The  value  of truth might seem selfevident  however  being that it is often the great liars and manipulators who come out on top  one should ask seriously   em  Why not deceive   em  Moreover   em  Why not allow oneself to be deceived   em  This is hardly facetious . Throughout his oeuvre  Nietzsche connects the acquisition of greater knowledge with  em  pain  em  .  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  Some knowledge might have pragmatic value  and certainly Nietzsche would see  wonder  and  curiosity  underlying the  will to truth   however  he views knowledge of the highest quality to be that which destroys the foundations of a culture and paralyzes an individual  s will to action . In his major treatise on historiography  Nietzsche associates knowledge with  the historical sense   that is  scholarly historicism and boldly concludes that ignorance  forgetfulness  and the denial history is of great value to a people or culture   p    p  No artist would ever paint a picture  no general would win a victory  no people would gain its freedom without first having longed for and struggled towards that end in such an  em  nhistorical  em  condition . Just as the man of action  in Goethe phrase  is always unscrupulous  so he is always ignorant too   HSDL   .  p    p  The man of profound knowledge might achieve a kind of power  but he is also prone to becoming a  Hamlet   a man nauseated by knowing and thinking too much  see BT   .  p    p  In Nietzsche  s mind   the value of truth  has a distinct origin  which I will discuss in the next section . Before this  it is useful to make some preliminary conclusions . Among these is the recognition that Nietzsche might not be as  postmodern  as is often thought . The idea that Nietzsche  s perspective on science is a refutation of truth and thus an assertion of  relativism  is doubtful . Zarathustra does not bring  relativism  to the world down from the mountaintop  but the terrible  em  truth  em  that God is dead . Any kind of defined systemwhether it be Science  Christianity  or Buddhismis based upon  in Walter Kaufmann  s words   a number of primary assumptions from which  one  draws a net of inferences and thus deduces  the  system  but  one  can not from within  the  system  establish the truth of his premises.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  Nietzsche attempts a bold new experiment in which he turns the  will to truth  against those most fundamental assumptionseven against itselfand tests whether the whole system might hold  or not.  p    p  In that the search for truth is only rarely practical and usually proves deleterious  it can only acquire meaning through a system of value outside itself . It is Nietzsche  s radical conclusion in Aphorism  that it is the JudeoChristian tradition that gave birth to the  will to truthat all costs.  In a characteristic dialectical flip  it is JudeoChristianity that birthed the sciences . It is in this way that Nietzsche ironically derives the title   How we  too  are still Pious    p    p   E  ven we seekers after knowledge today  we godless antimetaphysicians  still take our fire  too  from the flame lit by a faith that is thousands of years old  that Christian faith . . . that God is the truth  that truth is divine .  GS V     p    p  It is thus exactly that which is most harmed by the will to truth that brought it into the world.  p    p  How religion would become so audacious as to value truth is a complicated story  and one that emerges from Nietzsche  s view of history and the place of the Jews  Christians  and national politics in the ancient world.  p    p  Whatever Nietzsche eventually thought of the German nationstate  all of his texts evince a certain esteem  even nostalgia  for ancient  peoples   that is  historical races with their own culture and religion . As mentioned above  the Athenian  em  ethnos  em  was of central importance  but Nietzsche has similar reverence for other peoples of the ancient Mediterranean world and many across Europe and Asia . Nietzsche  s exact concept of a  people  is difficult to pin down . Obviously  the term is defined ethnically  and Nietzsche often uses  race  interchangeably with  people.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  However  for Nietzsche  a  people is far more than a mere biological entity . Although never made explicit  Nietzsche  s anthropology was greatly informed by a kind of  theory of the inheritance of acquired characteristics.  In the words of Menahem Brinker   A race is for him primarily a group of people united by their common lifeexperience which is interiorized and passed on from one generation to the next as cultural heritage and as inherited traits of character   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  .  National character  was forged over time.  p    p  Nietzsche  s concept of a people also had a prominent  em  theological  em  component   A people which still believes in itself retains its own god . In him it reveres the conditions which let it prevail  its virtuesit projects its pleasure in itself  its feeling of power onto a being to whom one may offer thanks   AC   . Under a national god  a people would construct a formal morality and system of values that was informed by the conditions for their wellbeing and position in the world . As Zarathuatra exclaims in his speech  Of Self Overcoming    What  a  people believe to be good and evil betrays to me an ancient will to power   Z II    . In the figure of the Hindu lawgiver Manuhis thought expressed in his law book   em  Manu Smriti  em   circa  B.C .  Nietzsche offers a concrete example of the legislatorcumchiefcumpriest who forges a great people . Manu  who became revered in Hinduism as the forefather of the entire human race  succeeded in Nietzsche  s mind by raising his people to kind of cultural and religious perfection . After a long era of fragmentation and chaos  Manu took the best that was achieved in this period of  experimentation  and codified a single  timeless religion and system of values . Nietzsche describes Manu  s culture as reaching an  automatism of instinct  in which values had become unconscious . He created a  second nature.   p    p  Just as  peoples  are at the center of Nietzsche  s concept of theology and value  so are they of great importance to his major discourses on epistemology . More specifically   a people  is directly connected in Nietzsche  s mind with his concept of the  will to truth  and the ways that this has manifested itself . Nietzsche  s most basic conclusion in this line is set down in  em  Zarathustra  em  in the aphorism  On the Famous Wise Men   Z II    . Here  it is the  famous philosophers  beloved by their communitieswho  in claiming to have reached  truth   have actually transformed the prejudices and superstitions of a people into dogma or philosophy . As he does throughout  em  Zarathustra  em   Nietzsche encapsulates this idea in a striking image  and in this case  it is one that is highly satirical  the  famous wise man  is an ass pulling a cart . The  cart   of course  represents  the people   who are grateful to their assphilosopher for his tireless efforts.  p    p  The sentiment that philosophers  or at least  famous  ones  are basically sophists and demagogues who  tell the people what they want to hear  is hardly new . However  this notion functions idiosyncratically within Nietzsche  s thought as a whole . Despite the obvious satire of the image  Nietzsche is not wholly opposed to  famous wise men.  As discussed above  Nietzsche has an irrepressible nostalgia for peoples who could write their  tables of good and evil  and were confident in themselves . For this   famous wise men  and their  truths  were indispensable . In many ways  Nietzsche views the decadence and cultural barrenness of Europe as expressed by their inability to invent a new theology . In reference to the  strong races of Northern Europe   Nietzsche laments that they never rejected the Christian God foisted upon them in the late Roman Empire  but instead allowed themselves to be defined by JudeoChristianity    a  lmost two thousand yearsand not a single new god    AC    .  p    p  National philosophers might have served their purpose  however  Nietzsche  s nostalgia has its limits  and he unequivocally rejects  national philosophy  as a worldview for Europe  s future . Nietzsche makes no effort to tell his age a quaint bedtime story or become Europe  s latest  or last   famous wise man.   p    p  Nietzsche  s sense that  national religions   at least within the confines of Europe  are both impossible and undesirable has much to do with his understanding of the JudeoChristian legacy . On one level  Christianity is for Nietzsche  just another religion   and it shares much in common with the national religions . In this case  it is an expression of the will to power of the downtrodden within the  em  imperium Romanum  em   and one can criticize it as such  as Nietzsche does at length in the  em  Genealogy  em   . But Nietzsche views this sociological insight as only of partial importance in assessing JudeoChristianity and its impact on Europe.  p    p  From the beginning  Nietzsche claims that Christianity was  at heart   em  never a national religion  em   and its dynamic was always expansive and supranational in character . In Nietzsche  s words  Christianity was  not a function of a raceit turned to every kind of man who was disinherited by life  it had its allies everywhere   AC   . From this broad base of support in the ancient world  the JudeoChristian legacy surfaced  in a variety of manifestations  and came to inform all peoples and classes of Europe  and beyond  . Christianity thus lacked completely other religions  basis in the sustenance of a distinct group  with its good and evil  high and low  sentiments and attachments.  p    p  But beyond this matter of scale  Nietzsche viewed Christianity as different in character from national religions . Much of this is expressed in the fact that Nietzsche views Christianity as possessing an epistemology radically different from the  national epistemologies  described above . More specifically  JudeoChristianity has a  will to truth  like no other . In Nietzsche  s mind  much of this results from Judaism  s place in the ancient world . In order to properly understand JudeoChristian epistemology  one must turn to the story of the Jews.  p    p  It is well known that Nietzsche was a fierce  em  anti  em  antiSemite . It was not particularly difficult for Nietzsche to take this position in the latter part of his career . AntiSemitism was indelibly linked in his mind with Wagner and the Bayreuth circle  his sister  s poor choice in husbands  and pompous German nationalismthat is to say  everything which Nietzsche found most distasteful and felt that he had to overcome in himself . Nietzsche  s hatred of antiSemitism culminated in his letter sent to Franz Overbeck  at the onset of madness in January of   announcing that he was  having all antiSemites shot.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  But then  being an antiantiSemite doesn  t quite mean that he was a philoSemite  nor does it quite tell us what Nietzsche thought of the Jews . Examined closely  Nietzsche  s depictions of Judaism and the Jews reveals that he was intensely ambivalent about botha certain antiSemitism and penchant for doubleedged compliments are combined with an enduring admiration . In his view  the Jews are  at the same time  a strong heroic people  a slaverace most responsible for the decline of aristocratic values  and potential  good Europeans.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup   p    p  Nietzsche unequivocally admires the Biblical Jewish people  and uses rapturous language to describe the  Homeric  world of the Pentateuch   great human beings  a heroic landscape  and something of the very rarest quality in the world  the incomparable na√Øvet√© of the  em  strong heart  em   what is more I find a people   GM III    . At this point in time  Judaism was a healthy and powerful national religion . Being that Jews and their political order were  in the right  that is  natural relationship to all things   they were able to create their own table of good and evil and invent a God that expressed their strength  Yahweh in his original form  was the expression of a consciousness of power  of joy in oneself  of hope for oneself  through him victory and welfare were expected   AC    .  p    p  But as the Jews began to experience defeat and subserviencerecast in historical terminology  in the period following the destruction of the First Temple  th Century B.C .  Yahweh began to lose his luster . In a striking admonishment  Nietzsche claims   they should have let him go   AC   . That is  once Yahweh ceased to be a god of power and victory  the Jews should have been creative enough to make a new one . This was  of course  common practice throughout the Roman Empire  as gods were ordered  created  and destroyed within the federalist Pantheon.  p    p  Instead  Jewish political life began to be dominated by a priestly class  and Yahweh was reimagined . If the Jews could not experience power in the real world  they claimed that  the good  was not found there but only in a new  higher  realm of morality . The god of the Jews became  in turn  an abstract demand  an  evileye   a  morality.  The situation was made worse by the fact that the priestly class transformed the Jewish historical consciousness  empowering themselves and devaluing the Biblical age of heroes which Nietzsche so admired   p    p   I  n the hands of the Jewish priests  the great age in the history of Israel became an age of decay  the Exile  the long misfortune  was transformed in to an eternal punishment for the great agean age in which the priest was still a nobody   AC   .  p    p  Judaism was further affected by the Jews  conflicts with the Roman Empire  culminating in the destruction of the Second Temple  st Century  B.C.  . It is  indeed  this confrontation through which Nietzsche generates one of his most characteristic opposition   Rome against Judea  Judea against Rome  Rome felt the Jews to be something like antinature itself  its antipodal monstrosity as it were  in Rome the Jew stood  em  convicted  em  of hatred for the whole human race   GM I    .  Judea against Rome  is the depiction not of too rival nations and national religions but of two completely opposed  em  Weltanschauungen  em  and moral systems  on one side  there is the aristocratic masterclass  conscious of its own power  and able to subordinate and integrate rival nations into a stable  productive hierarchy  on other  there is a small  wretched tribe of people claiming no national power  as they had none   but then making a grasp for universal dominion.  p    p  In Nietzsche  s reading  the Jews are  the most  em  catastrophic  em  people in world history   AC    but not merely because they created a religion of  em  ressentiment  em  directed against the aristocratic Romans . For as a religion of a weak people  Judaism would hardly be unusual in this respect and would never have gained worldhistorical significance . The Jews were truly catastrophic in that they transformed the nature of religion itself.  p    p  In order to understand the new metaphysics created in Judaism  it is useful to turn to Nietzsche  s description of the formation of the conscience and the sense of guilt . Drawing on the fact that the German word   em  Schuld  em   refers to both  debt   in the monetary sense  and  guilt   in the moral sense   Nietzsche claims that  in the prehistory of mankind  the moral conscience emerged as an internalization of the punishment one received for failing to repay loans . The feeling of guilt is a means for man to punish himself by reproducing the fear and loathing of indebtedness in other contexts . Obviously  this had a classdimension  for it is primarily the lower orders and weaker nations who experienced chronic indebtedness  and thus were more likely to develop the internalization . The Jews underwent an intensification of this process in that not only were they constantly in a position of subservience  em  vis√†vis  em   master  nations  but their culture became dominated by a priestly class that eagerly transformed  guiltdebt  into a exaltation of their weak and downtrodden state  the  ascetic ideal.   p    p  Nietzsche relates that  as this process ensued  this painful internalization of guilt became simply too great for the slave to bear  and he and his society sought a means of discharging it . This could take many forms  Nietzsche views the primary one as entailing a grand reversal  a projection back of the feeling of debt onto the  creditor   that is  the master . The Jews thus formed an entire metaphysics based upon  em  ressentiment  em  . The  transvaluation of all values  that is  the valuing of the weak  shameful slaves as  good  and the powerful  conscienceless rulers as  evil  operated through this process in the latter days of the ancient world.  p    p  This great  reversal of guilt   so to speak  is directly related to the Jews  development of monotheism and a universal religion . In Nietzsche  reading of history  it is the Jews and the original Christian slaveclasses throughout the Empire that achieved the  maximum feeling of guilty indebtedness   em  des Schuldgef√ºhl  em   on earth.  Nietzsche views this as expressed by a universalist theory and  the maximum god attained thus far   GM II     the one  true godYahweh . Not only did the Jews and Christians divorce their god from the attainment of worldly power  but in imagining a higher realm  they grasped at a kind of grand  em  coup d  √©tat  em  . The refashioned Yahweh was above the gods of Rome and all other deities  indeed  he superseded them . The Jews were the inventors of what Nietzsche calls  the grand style in morality   BGE VIII    . In this way  Nietzsche imagines a great clash of universal religions  on the one hand  JudeoChristian monotheism  and on the other  the Imperium Romanum and its Pantheon.  p    p  In the struggle of  Rome against Judea   Judea won . Nietzsche views this as happening mostly on a psychological level  put simply  the allencompassing Judaic  and later JudeoChristian  system entrapped the nobles and made them feel guilty about themselves  about their power  beauty  and dominance . Beyond the Roman aristocrats  Nietzsche sees the preJudeoChristian world as replete with a host of figures who   imbued with faith in their own perfection  went about with the dignity of a great matador   these were the great masters who had confidence in their ability to achieve power and  it should be mentioned  were unafraid to be cruel .  Moral Skepticism  that is  the  evil eye  and the unflagging criticism of the JudeoChristian systemsucceeded in drawing into question all of the noble man  s great strengthspride  ruthlessness  ambitionand in  accusing and embittering him  to the point that he lost faith in himself  GS III    .  p    p  Nietzsche views this great  loss of nerve  as lamentable  for there is little doubt that he felt the great  cruel masterclass to be the foundation of high culture in the ancient world . This being said  Nietzsche recognizes that the  transvaluation of all values  is at the heart of the sciences and the modern systems of knowledge . Indeed  Nietzsche views Judaism and Christianity as the first religions to fully systematize the potential of doubt and skepticism . The ancient Jew and Christian might originally pursue  truth  out of  em  ressentiment  em   in the sense of  bringing the great down to size  or  looking up the skirt  of the Queen . But this is transformed into a call for knowledge for its own sake . As Nietzsche points out  it is no coincidence that the great philosophers have been social outcastsHeraclitus  Socrates  Epicurius  Nietzsche  BGE I    .  em  Ressentiment  em  is the secret  guilty origin of philosophy . Moreover  with the expansion to universalism  the acquisition of knowledge becomes a duty  a painful binding of the self to achieve knowledge  for its own sake  and  at all costs.   p    p  Furthermore  it is with man  s  turning against himself  that it becomes possible to enact a great transformation of values . In this line  it is the dynamic of JudeoChristian  em  ressentiment  em  that gives substance to Nietzsche  s metaphor  quoted above  of the  taut bow.   Turned against himself   JudeoChristian man is a strange  seemingly  unnatural   being  but as such he begins to view himself no longer as an end but as a stage in a grand transformation   p    p   T  he existence on earth of an animal soul turned against itself . . . was something so new  profound  unheard of  enigmatic  contradictory   em  and pregnant with a future  em  that the aspect of the earth was essentially altered . . . .  M  an . . . gives rise to an interest  a tension  a hope  almost a certainty  as if with him something were announcing and preparing itself  as if man were not a goal but only a way  an episode  a bridge  a great promise.  GM II     p    p  In describing the development of the systems of knowledge  Nietzsche returns to the image of the  taut bow  and  great politics.  Judaism gave birth not only to the universalism and value of truth that characterize European societies  but also to the capacity to transfigure radically these values.  p    p  As explored in the following section  this aspect of JudeoChristian legacy is of particular importance in informing Nietzsche  s discussions of thcentury European politics and his hope for supranational integration.  p    p  Publishing in the latter third of the th century  Nietzsche couldn  t help but comment on the most important political development of his timenationalism . In his mature period  Nietzsche  s stance towards the nationstate was almost uniformly hostile .  This might come as a surprise to those who associate him with German National Socialism .  In these discussions  Nietzsche is not interested in sovereignty or the state in themselves so much as their modern  republican  and  nationaldemocratic  variations . In this line  the central political problem for Nietzsche is one of  em  representation  em  . Nietzsche  or Zarathustra to be exact  claims that the state exists through a central lie   I  the state  am the people.  It is this equation and promise of representation that  after the collapse of  divine right  and absolutism  became the fundamental source of legitimacy.  p    p  Whereas healthy peoples are able to write their own tablets of good and evil  Zarathustra calls the modern state  the death of peoples  and  in an ironic reference to Hobbes  Leviathan    the coldest of all cold monsters   Z I    . While a great legislator like Manu was a  creator  he brought order to his culturethe modern state is an  annihilator.  It simply  takes   its managers exist by taxing those below them . And it is a  em  cold  em  monster in that it  bask  s  in the sunshine  of the allegiance and men of actual achievement . And  to Zarathustra  s dismay  it has seduced the  great souls  of every nation . Here  Nietzsche certainly has in mind a figure like Wagner  after the events of  he was a nomadic artist who radically rethought the operatic form  by  and the establishment of the Bayreuth festival  he was  nationalized  and thus became  respectable  and  palatable.   p    p  Keeping in mind Nietzsche  s esteem and nostalgia for the age of peoples  it is important to note that his critique of the modern state functions around a nationstate opposition . As mentioned above  Nietzsche  s mature work is filled with barbs against all things German  however  the moments in which he criticizes the German state are exactly those in which he allows himself to recognize the cultural achievement of the German peopleeven if he does this in the form of his signature doubleedged complements.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  While in other works Nietzsche depicts Germans as lugubrious beerguzzlers   em  vis√†vis  em  their state  they are a people of ponderous depths  fixatedperhaps to a faulton a vision of the future  BGE VIII    . Germans famously have an identity crisis  It is characteristic of the Germans that the question   what is German   never dies out amongst them   BGE VIII    but then this makes them philosophical . In light of Nietzsche  s political ideal of the good European  it is certainly significant here that he depicts the German soul as disposed to  cosmopolitanism   BGE VIII    . In  years after the founding of the Reichhe exclaimed    German spirit   for the past eighteen years a contradiction in terms   TI I    . In a clear reference to the leader of the new Germany  Otto von Bismarck  Nietzsche speaks of  a statesman  who convinced the Germans to sacrifice their great virtues for the sake of a  novel and dubious mediocrity   BGE VIII    . Bismarck was able to seduce the Germans through  in Nietzsche  s exact words   Great Politics.  Far from being the merger of politics and the war of spirits that Nietzsche foresaw in  em  Ecce Homo  em   EC IV     Bismarck  s  great politics  is little more than pomp and circumstance  a parody of actual greatness . The great chancellor  piles up for  the Germans  another tower of Babel  a monster of empire and power   and willing citizens  grovel on their bellies before anything massive   BGE VIII    . Nietzsche holds his nose at this spectacle and refers to the process as the  spiritual flattening  of a people . In becoming citizens of the Reich  Germans forgo their spiritual boundlessness and learn  politicking.   p    p  Like most critics of nationalism  Nietzsche is quick to place national formation within a particular historical context and deconstruct any claims the nationstate might have of being an organic outgrowth out of an ancient community . Far from representing an eternal  em  Deutsch  em   Nietzsche views the Reich as a part of a Europeanwide spirit of secular republicanism . And despite Kaiser Wilhelm  s claims of divine sovereignty  he views the Reich as part of  Europe  s  em  democratic  em  movement   BGE VIII    . In this line  Nietzsche generally criticizes the nationstate in much the same way that he criticizes the Enlightenment  s political offspring  democracy and liberalism . Democratic and republican politics seek to oppress the great individual exemplars of the human species and mark the lowering of tastes to suit the herd . Nietzsche takes this point very far  even speculating that democratization was actually a   em  physiological  em  process  in which Europeans were quite literally getting flatter and flatter and more and more boring . Europeans are no longer a collection of peoples  but a homogenous mass.  p    p  This being said  Nietzsche is not merely an aristocratic conservative  lamenting the dumbingdown of tastes  though he certainly did lament the dumbingdown of tastes  . Just as with the discussion of  shadows over Europe   Nietzsche views this  massification  of peoples as inevitable and irreversible  indeed  he attempts to glimpse a potential transformation taking place  em  through  em   not against  the  democratic movement.  Indeed  Nietzsche provocatively imagines that the great leveling will eventuate in a  result which would seem to be least expected by those who naively praise  the process of democratization   the apostles of  modern ideas.   For the new  democratic man  in the form of either the  last man  described in  em  Zarathustra  em   Z I  P    or the  garrulous worker  in  em  Beyond Good and Evil  em   BGE VIII    shall be  in status if not name  a slave . Slaves  of course  need Masters  much like cattle need cowboys . And this means that  in exceptional cases the  em  strong  em  human being will have to turn out stronger and richer than perhaps ever before.  The democratization of Europeans will be the opportunity for the  cultivation of  em  tyrants  em  .   p    p  In the wake of thcentury totalitarianisms  Nietzsche  s call for the cultivation of tyrants is undoubtedly unwelcome . As Jacob Golomb and Robert Wistrich observe  Nietzsche is not a protoFascist or Nazi  but he is most definitely a kind of  godfather  of these movements . In their words  he was a  prophet of the spiritual vacuum that gave birth to the totalitarian abysses of the twentieth century . As such he remains profoundly relevant to our time.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  But then  perhaps one could push Nietzsche  s  totalitarian  connection much further than Golomb and Wistrich would like . Both Hitler and Stalin might even seem to be an excellent candidate for the  artist tyrant  in that both sustained their dictatorship by replacing politics with the spectacle of power . Nietzsche  of course  never discusses things like a  onepartystate  or the  F√ºhrer principle   however  in his unpublished writings  which were collected as  em  The Will to Power  em      he did specifically speak of  international racial unions whose task will be to rear a  em  master  em  race   WP   . Furthermore  in stressing the need for fearless new conquerors  he rhetorically asks   Where are the barbarians of the twentieth century    WP   .  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup   p    p  Nietzsche never published any statements like this in his lifetime  and it is irresponsible to treat them uncritically as definitive components of his philosophy . Nevertheless  the questions that such a statement evoke are serious and invariably color any reading of Nietzsche  s political philosophy . Without doubt there is a certain racial  eugenicist component to Nietzsche  s vision of the new Europe  however  it is of vital importance to look very closely at exactly how Nietzsche depicts his projected tyrants and masters of Europe . Nietzsche might be notorious for writing positively about the  blond beast  and the  noble races   GM I      sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  but ultimately both of these figures are part of Nietzsche  s vision of  prehistory   of the halfforgotten memory of man . They are not the Masters of Europe  who will arise after the death of God.  p    p  Nietzsche ultimately never details who the Overman   em  √úbermensch  em   is  much as Marx remained poetic and elliptical when he described communism . That said  he offers glimpses . . .  p    p  It is useful to begin this discussion with the figure of the  good European.  Nietzsche is most explicit about what he means by this term when he discuses the role of the Jews in modern European society . Nietzsche  s portrait of the Jewish people is  in many ways  familiar  he writes of them as wandering without a home  still alienated from the European national communities even after the widespread liberal reforms improving their treatment . Their alien status has certain benefits  however  for in being excluded from national life  the Ashkenazim maintain their own distinct cultural traditions and remain  in Nietzsche  s words  a people   em  aere perennius  em    more enduring than bronze.  p    p  With this in mind  Daniel Conway has suggested that the European Jews stand for Nietzsche as a kind of political alternative  a living critique of his grand vision of a renewed Roman Empire   Despite his bold  Europhilic swagger  he feared that  em  they  em   the Jews  may have succeeded in formulating the optimal strategy for promoting cultural advancement in late modernity.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  This claim is highly useful in that it is  in my view  a misreading of Nietzsche  s position towards the Ashkenazim  but then it brings to the fore an important point . It is certainly true that Nietzsche saw the value in being the outsider  all great philosophers are outsiders  including Nietzsche himself . Furthermore  Zarathustra speaks directly to the lonely and disposed in his call for the creation of a new spiritual order   You that are lonely today  you that are withdrawing  you shall one day be the people  out of you  who have chosen yourselves  there shall grow a chosen peopleand out of them the overman   Z I    . It might seem that here Nietzsche is calling for a kind of  Jewish  good European  the Good European as a wandering nomad . Those who have  chosen themselves  will form an ironic  chosen people.   p    p  Nietzsche undoubtedly desires to empower those who stand against the modern world  however  in this scheme  they are not to remain  free spirits  for long . In the above quotation  Nietzsche does not imagine the alienated as forever standing apart  but as ultimately triumphing  as giving birth to a higher stage of humanity  and thus laying the foundations for rule . Similarly  what Nietzsche admires in the Jews   optimal strategy  is not their apartness in itself  but their potential to achieve  mastery over Europe   BGE VIII    . Indeed  Nietzsche scolds the Jews for trying to assimilate into national cultures . Were these indestructible  nomadic people not capable of much more  for better and for worse  In making such claims  Nietzsche does not reveal himself to be a kind of  Jewish supremacist   so to speak . The Jew  who has survived persecution and attempted annihilationsurvived even national assimilation and who has built international networksare an image  at least in part  of what a  Good European  might be.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  ffn     a   sup  But the Ashkenazim  s international culture and  morality in the grand style   which has been developed into a variety of ethical philosophies  make them particularly well suited for the governance of the continent.  p    p  In no better way does Nietzsche express that his political project amounts to a  transvaluation of all values   for it is the wanderers and nomads who were  as physical types  those to whom Christianity would most likely appeal in the ancient world  and furthermore  those who would most likely succeed in crafting a religion of  em  ressentiment  em  against the nobility . The lonely and dispossessed are poised to become a new master class.  p    p  Immediately following his paean to the  em  imperium Romanum  em  quoted at the beginning of this essay  Nietzsche offers a glimpse of his ideal of the man who might sit on the throne . His language here is grandiose and deserves to be quoted at length   p    p  I envisage a  em  possibility  em  of a perfect supraterrestrial magic and fascination of color  it seems to me that it glistens in all the tremors of subtle beauty  that an art is at work in it  so divine  so devilishly divine that one searches millennia in vain for a second such possibility     em  Cesare Borgia as pope  em  . Am I understood   AC    p    p  The imagery is meant to shock  and Nietzsche  s effusiveness expresses his glee in blasphemy . But then Nietzsche intends   em  Cesare Borgia as pope  em   to be taken seriously  and such an image connects to many components of his wider political thought . In installing Borgia in Rome  Nietzsche means to attack the JudeoChristian tradition  in the decisive place  in the very seat of Christianity  placing the  em  noble  em  values on the throne   going further  he seeks to bring these values  right into the instincts  into the lowest needs and desires of those who sat there   AC   . A polemical or merely blasphemous opposition to Christianityin which case he would image a  sultan in Babylon  or the likeis nowhere to be seen . To the contrary  Nietzsche seeks to reconstitute the entire JudeoChristian legacy . The  instincts  and  lowest needs and desires  of the Jew or Christian are transformed into the foundation for a new aristocratic order . Just as the  good European  marks a kind of reversal of the tradition of Jewish  em  ressentiment  em   so Nietzsche imagines the coming tyrants as an upside down version of the greatest of all priestly classes.  p    p  Bergman  Peter .  .  em  Nietzsche   the Last Antipolitical German.   em  Bloomington  IN  Indiana University Press.  p    p  Brinker  Menahem .  .

At one point  I started  a href  http  en.wikipedia.orgwikiOrangeOrder   wearing Orange  a  on March  . . . though the message was seemingly lost on most everyone I encountered.  p    p  Much like Halloween  St. Patrick  s Day has emerged as an excuse to get dressed up  get drunk  and get laid . The same goes for the German festival of Oktoberfest  which is growing in popularity . But Ocktoberfest retains a connection to authenticity and tradition  which I find totally absent in the spring festival of idiots wearing Guinness novelty top hats and obnoxious women screaming while making group selfies.  p    p  We moderns  who are living out the End of History  think that cultural festivals are something for those  em  other  em  peoples . The Day of the Dead  the Thai Pongal  and Carnival are for those who haven  t quite entered modernity  who lack our selfconsciousness  rootlessness  and irony . In this way  we don  t consider St. Patrick  s Day to be a real holiday at all . But truly  what we celebrate and how we celebrate it reveals who we are  and the shared assumptions amongst Americans of many races.  p    p  In  em  The Good Shepard  em      Robert De Niro  s flawed but fascinating drama about the origins of the CIA  there is a quotable exchange that might be a fitting epigraph for the tombstone of the AngloSaxon Protestant elite .

He has dedicated himself totally to his agency and to the Cold War  which was imagined as a titanic  allornothing battle for the world . At the end of his life  Wilson is so estranged from his wife and son  he barely seems to know them  his only passion appears to be building model boats in bottles.  p    p  Wilson here is an intense example of a general tendency among WASPs to dissolve their ethnic and racial identity into a corporate entity  the United States of America . Wilson is America . . . and isn  t at the same time . The USA is the vehicle for WASP power and identity  but its real essence is that of a mass  managerial bureaucracy and geopolitical administrator . Ultimately  Wilson and his class were also  just visiting   they were just one more people to occupy the U.S.A.  s upperlevels management positions  and were easily replaced by Liebowitzs  Chens  and even O  Reillys.  p    p  St . Patrick  s Day is the celebration of the Underdognot only the Irish themselves but the perennial  mythic Underdog that is always  just visiting  the United States . What is characteristic about the U.S. is that there is no celebration of the Overdog . There is no St. George  s Day festival  memorializing the people that defined America .

On the other side are the reactionaries . They are  reactionaries  because they have no real position on Islam  they only know that the liberals are wrong  and reflexively counterattack . Theirs is a form of hypercriticism  given to denying longestablished facts and trends of Islamic history with little or no justification other than to refute the Islamophiles . Given the current situation in the West  their excesses are understandable . But the reactionaries  zeal leads them to stake out indefensible positions . Many of them are have ulterior motivessome are proJewish fanatics or apologists for imperialism  others are democratic ideologues . But they share a defect . They lack a healthy  Faustian drive to pursue universal Truthwhether we like its conclusions or not.  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      Both approaches fail for two reasons . First  neither affords its subject the proper attitude of  sympathetic criticism.  The student must devote himself to understanding a culture on its own termslearning its languages  reading its history and literatureall the while imagining things from its perspective . Once he has done this  he can render judgement on its ethics  its cultural attainments  and its overall importance to history . This was the approach of the great orientalists of the late th and early th century . They devoted tremendous intellectual effort to comprehending Islamic civilization  yet they were unafraid to pass judgement on its shortcomings . The liberals have no aptitude for criticism  the reactionaries have none for sympathy.  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      Second  the liberals and reactionaries neglect the questions of philosophical history . It is from this oversight that they fall into their assumption of perpetual historical progress . But there is a better way . One hundred years ago  Oswald Spengler reframed the discussion of history by tearing down idea of progress  at least as it is commonly understood  . His  Copernican revolution  in historical thought worked wonders for the study of Classical civilization and Europe  but it would prove even more effective for understanding the meaning of Middle Eastern history . Spengler shifted the emphasis away from time and toward Cultures . Following Spengler  we can understand how meaningless most of the questions posed by conventional commenters are  and begin to see Islam for what it really is.  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      Spengler rejected the conventional historical focus on religions and polities . He saw these as merely superficial expressions of something deeperthe Culture . Cultures  in Spengler  s scheme  are a complex of peoples who share a worldoutlook . This outlookthe spirit of a Culturedrives it to produce or adapt a religion .  Religion  is the outward expression of the worldoutlook and includes such things as prayer rituals  religious architecture  calligraphy and sculpture . For example  while EuroAmericans and Korean evangelicals may both be  Christians   they do not belong to the same Culture  because their worldoutlooks differ so drastically  despite their notionally common religion . A presentday American protestant has more in common  spiritually  with a thcentury Norse pagan than with a modernday Korean convert  despite professing the same doctrines . Cultures are the basic unit by which to analyze history.  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      Islam is part of the  Magian  Culture . In his  span   i   span style  fontweight      Decline of the West  span   i   span style  fontweight       Spengler defines the Magian Culture as comprising the Muslim Arabs  but also many preIslamic Middle Eastern groups such as the Babylonian Jews  the Zoroastrians  the Coptic and Syriac Christians  as well as syncreticheretical gnostic groups like the Manichaeans . It arose around the time of Christ and lasted till the th century  when the antirationalist thinker AlGhazali dealt the deathblow to Magian philosophical speculation . All of subsequent Magian history was  in Spengler  s view   civilization  grandiose  bombastic  imperial  but sterile . No new philosophical or religious ideas could arise from the Magian world outlook . It had run its course.  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      So the birth of Islam does not represent the foundation of a new religion . It was  rather  a revolution in Magian religious thought . As such  it is analogous to the Reformation in Western history . Like Luther  Muhammad preached a puritanical systematization of earlier currents in the spiritual thought of his Culture . Muhammad and Luther were both anticlerical  iconoclastic reformers who exhorted their adherents to build a more personal relationship with God . They both made the scripture accessible to the massesLuther by translating the bible into the vernacular  Muhammad by  receiving revelations  in easily memorized rhymed prose . After their deaths  their Cultures were unified the culture by marginalizing the earlier creeds and  at the same time  quickly spawning an array of heresies . The puritanical movements unleashed a storm  driving the postreformation Europeans and postIslam Magians to conquer half the world in a fanatical outburst of religious fervorcompare that to the religious and colonial wars of Europe in the th and th centuries .  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      Both movements  to a large degree  cleansed their cultures of foreign influence . Hellenistic influence on the Middle East  while not wiped out  was severely reduced in the first centuries of Islam . The Greek language  long the lingua franca of the Eastern Mediterranean  died out in Egypt and Syria  and later in Anatolia . To use Spengler  s term  Islam ended the hellenistic pseudomorphosis  falsedevelopment  of early Magian Culture  allowing it to come into its own . Likewise Luther and his successors purged Northern Europe of the illfitting GrecoRoman influence imposed by the Catholic Church . More and more  the European cultural initiative drifted northward . The centers of art migrated from Florence and Rome to Nuremberg  Rotterdam and Weimar . The Italian composers of the baroque were  by degrees  superseded by the likes of Bach and Handel . Thus Muhammad is not an Islamic Jesus  but a Luther . His movement  Islam  is a puritanical systematization of earlier currents in the Magian spirit .  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      All this flies in the face of the conventional wisdom . Lacking any deeper insight into the place of Islam in history  the MassMedia has been promoting a meme   Islam needs a Reformation  eg   a href  http  www.wsj.comarticlesareformationforislam   WSJ  a  .   span   span style  fontweight       a href  http  www.huffingtonpost.comrazarumiislamneedsreformationfb.htm   HuffPo  a  .  span   span style  fontweight       . It makes sense superficially . Based on the conventional historical assumptions  one would compare Muhammad to Jesus as founders of worldreligions . It follows then that Islam  having gotten a late start  is due for a reformation . After all  it  s been  centuries since Muhammad fled to Medina  and about the same duration separates Jesus from Martin Luther . The preReformation Church superficially resembles currentday Islam .  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      But with a deeper understanding of history  comparing Jesus to Muhammad is preposterous . In contrasting the current state of the West and the Middle East  it would be ridiculous to set the two up as analogues . Jesus no longer matters to Faustian man . When the decadent West looks for myths and heroes  it looks for worlddenying saints of Tolerance and Progress . New heros must spring up or be manufacturedMLK and Gandhi  Anne Frank and Mother Theresa . Jesus would seem to fit the mold  but he is too boundup in the popular imagination with the distant past . And in the popular imagination  History is Progress  therefore the farther back you go  the more evil everything is . But the West has absolutely no need for heroic menoftheworld like Luther  so his place in our history is undervalued.  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      Unlike the West  the Middle East is not in an age of decadence . It seems to be waking from its long hibernation . The reborn Islamic fury  much pondered in the West  is neither merely another episode in the Middle East  s supposedly nonstop violence  nor is it the necessary outcome of Islam  s doctrines . That its people are still  Muslims  is of less consequence than its stage of historical development . Islam has not been perennially aggressive  and the Middle East has not been a  region of conflict beset by ancient hatreds.  For centuries following the Crusades the Arabs and Persians no longer mattered . Islam  s last great conquests were not carried out by these  coreMagians   but by the Berbers  Turks and Mughals . And these imperial peoples could only prolong the agony of Magian decline . From the th century to the th  Islam was dormant  because the Magian Culture was dead .  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      Thus the Magians  span   i   span style  fontweight      ahead  span   i   span style  fontweight      of the West . Not only have they undergone a Reformation  but they have also gone through a Golden Age and the inevitable Age of Decadence . A few centuries after Muhammad  around the s  Islam began to lose its vigour . It briefly lost some of its core territoriesSyria and Palestineto the new  energetic  Faustian  Culture . It mustered the strength to repulse the intruders  but continued losing ground on its peripheries . The Mongols almost dealt the  span   i   span style  fontweight      coup de grace  span   i   span style  fontweight      by sacking Baghdad in  . Here we find the best analogy .  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      The weakened Islam of the s is where The West finds itself nowbeset by external enemies  barely able to rally the strength to defend itself . In its last centuries  Islam still endured wars and changes of dynasty  but no revolutions of thought or spirit . From the end of the Crusades till WWI  not much happened . Classic histories of the Arabs recognized thisin over  pages of  span   i   span style  fontweight      The History of the Arabs  span   i   span style  fontweight       the Lebanese Christian scholar Philip Hitti devoted less than  to anything after the th century .  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      Herein lies their value to our understanding of the West  s place in history . By examining the trajectory of their Culture  we can see the outlines of our own future . Neither the liberal nor the reactionary approach has any value as history  only as polemic.  span   p    p   span style  fontweight      What can we look forward to  If the postMongol Islamic history is any guide  it  s going to be a bit mixed . Islam seemingly regained the initiative in the th centuryejecting the Crusaders and launching counteroffensives on its Eastern and Western frontiers . But this revival only came about because Islam received infusions of fresh Turkish and Mongol blood .

The fact that National Football League games followed  or replaced  Christian services lent them a certain  em  religious  em  quality . To oppose football would have been  for millions of Americans  the equivalent of denouncing dear old mom . For me  growing up in Texas in the s and  s  playing varsity football was nothing less than a rite of passage into manhood.  p    p  But over the past decade  football  s  untouchable  status has withered . Much of this has to do with highprofile cases of domestic violence . But more than anything  awareness of the impact of concussions and CTE is driving a silent boycott of the sport . Football is collapsing from the bottom up  as suburban parents pull their sons out of peewee leagues and encourage them to take up water polo or crosscountry . As scientists continue to learn more about the impact of repeated trauma to the brain  especially in early life  an ever greater number of people will find the sport taboo and unwatchable on a professional level .  The NFL has already reached a   million dollar settlement with former players over concussionrelated injuries and illnesses . No doubt  trial lawyers are salivating over the chance to plunder the industry for all its worth .   p    p  But ultimately  the concussion phenomenon is not a good reason to stop watching football . They  re grown men  after all  and the impulse to risk one  s health for fame and glory is admirable . Yes  football is dangerous  but the real reason we must stop watching football is that the sport is making us  em  less  em  dangerous   em  less  em  vital in critically important ways . Football fandom is domesticating White people . It  s turning us into meatsacks without agency . We are passive spectators  not just of sports but of history . There is a pressing need for us to unplug ourselves from the football machineto become atheists of the pigskin religionand dispel the mesmerizing quality it has over us minds.  p    p  A common refrain from many  conservative  football fans and commentators is that we should focus on  what happens on the field   and put race and politics aside . To the contrary . We must look at the impact this industry has  em  off the field  em   on politics  culture  society  sex  and raceon our morality  values  and hopes and dreams . We must look at how football makes us act and think.  p    p  In my lifetime  football has gone from being an cultural idol to yet one more American institution suffering from legitimacy crisisand with no obvious path to redemption . There is no better time to sound it out  to discover what  s hallow and what is resonate  what  s salvagble and what must be discarded.  p    p  On September     Donald Trump launched a new front in the culture war . More accurately  he revealed a racial and political animus that was simmering under the surface of professional sports for decades . At a rally in Alabama  one of the most football mad places in America  Trump went offscript   p    p  Wouldn  t you love to see one of these NFL owners  when somebody disrespects our flag  to say   Get that son of a bitch off the field right now  out  he  s fired .

Trump was quick to claim that his opposition was  not about race  and only about  disrespecting the flag.  But for everyone participating in the protest  it was  em  all about race  em   and not just about police violence  . In the  a href  http  www.nfl.comnewsstoryaparticlecolinkaepernickexplainswhyhesatduringnationalanthem   words of Kaepernick  a    p    p  I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.  p    p  By   Kaepernick was no longer in the League . His performance had noticeably declined  and his theatrics apparently rendered him unsignable . But his absence only intensified the controversy  making him a kind of martyr of the racist system he protested.  p    p  Sportswriters  who tend to be soft liberals  have long cheered on the politicization of sports . It lends a  seriousness  to an otherwise of juvenile profession composed of nerds writing about jocks . It  s also a way of addressing the troubling dynamics of an overwhelmingly White audience cheering on overwhelmingly Black athletes  which I  ll discuss further below  .  p    p  The Anthem protestand the reaction to itwas yet another instance in the long saga once known as  The Negro Question  the political and social status of Africans living in a White country  slave or citizen  American or something else . To be fair  AfricanAmericans have to honestly ask themselves  Can we take part in the pageantry of a country that has never really been ours  and which  until very recently  maintained our social and political inferiority  Is assimilation possible  If so  is it desirable  And if not  then what   p    p  Kaepernick himself was particularly ambivalent about this question . He is of mixed race  with an absent Black father and a White mother who put him up for adoption . He was raised in Wisconsin by an apparently loving and nonracist White family . But assimilation and the warm embrace create anxiety  and Kaepernick is clearly in search of the authenticity  the  creed  of really being Black . In   he also sported an Afro.  p    p  On the other side  White fans perceive race  correctly  as a weapon used against them in all aspects of life  affirmative action  the  diversity  racket  White Guilt  White Privilege  etc . They thus seek  always unsuccessfully  to neutralize the subject with the promise of multiracial American patriotism or silly euphemisms like  We don  t  em  see  em  race.  The teamwork and  em  esprit de corps  em  offers the promise to Whites of one institutions where race really won  t matter . Trump  s demand that those spoiled athletes just shut up and be patriotic was a kind of last stand of this implicit White identity.  p    p  Trump certainly didn  t seek to destroy the NFL when he yelled  You  re fired   in Alabama . To the contrary  he sought to save football from itself . But the effect was something altogether different . White fans were already deeply  unconsciously troubled by the racial dynamic of the NFL . In fighting back  Trump revealed what was at stake . Fans saw the game with new eyes and found it unwatchable.  p    p  According to polling  NFL  s  a href  https  www.forbes.comsitesmikeozanianthenflsthreemostimportantmoneyindicatorsarepointingdown  bbeae   favorability rating dropped  a  from  percent to  percent  from  to  percent among males .

American Whites  or those from the declining middle class  spend the majority of their lives working jobs they don  t like simply to earn enough money to move away from dangerous  nonWhite neighborhoods where it is impossible to raise a family . They live their lives in recognition of racial reality  and then spend their luxury time retreating into racial fantasy .

After all  he  s the one paying money for athletes to entertain him . And while a select few players garner fame  wealth  and women  the vast majority will be left with broken bodies and the indifference of the masses . It  s a pattern as old as the Roman Coliseum  but the racial disparity between fan and playerenveloped in a national ideology of racial egalitarianismgives it a new dynamic.  p    p  The more thoughtful sportswriters have often  a href  https  www.amazon.comFortyMillionDollarSlavesRedemptiondp   suggested  a  something inherently exploitative about the fanplayer relationshipand  to a great extent  they  re right . Robert E. Lee observed that slavery degrades both master and slave  in turn  fandom degrades both player and fan . The Black player sees himself as a kind of performing monkey  a highpaid slave who puts his body and ego on the line for overweight White fans who will call him abusive names if he drops a pass or blows a coverage  that is  if he makes the kinds of mistakes everyone makes everyday  .  p    p  The fan simultaneously dehumanizes and idealizes the Black athlete . On the one hand  the athlete is a beast of burden  a commodity to be traded  wagered on  feted or laughed at depending on the situation .  By the time they  re sophomores in highschool  Black athletes have been scrutinized and quantified down to their yarddash time and hand size on recruiting Websites like  a href  https  rivals.com   Rivals.com  a  .  On the other hand  the fan views the athlete as a hero and unreachable pinnacle of masculinity  as something more than a man.  p    p  This kind of ambivalence is volatile . And as seen by some ugly confrontations on the field  just beneath the mutual admiration between players and fans is an intense contempt . The White fans who pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars on the tickets or merchandise to honor their favorite players would lock their doors if they saw them walking on the street .

And at some level  he must recognize the absurd and untenable position he  s put himself in . For he isn  t just selling football game  he  s selling  America  s Team.  It  s a civic icon based on a nation of players who are criminally out of control and utterly alienated from sentiments like  God and Country.   p    p  Just win  Jerry  while it lasts  p    p  With few exceptions  all the truly great NFL quarterbacks have been White  and not just White  but Anglo and Germanic  Joe Montana  John Elway  Otto Graham  Roger Staubach  Peyton Manning  Aaron Rodgers  and more . And Whites are still overrepresented at the position . But the  golden boys  often obscure two important facts . First  Whites are tremendously underrepresented in the NFL and major colleges  Whites make up  percent of the U.S. population but only  percent of NFL players . Secondly  White athletes are often pigeonholed into certain positions  Whites can be tightends  but only rarely widereceivers  they can maybe play safety but never cornerback  a White running back can be a  good blocker  or  role player   but not a starting tailback.  p    p  Over the last  years  the website   a href  http  castefootball.usindex.php   Caste Football  a   has put forth the provocative thesis that American footballfrom the NFL down to junior varsityis captured by  group think.  There is an assumption of Black superiority  in terms of speed  agility  flexibility  and White athletes are never given the opportunity to excel . This thesis  no doubt  carries a kernel of truth  as  group think  infects every industry . And although it is politically incorrect  it is by no means as radically taboo as the alternative explanation  that Africans are genetically predisposed to excel at football . Deron Snyder of the Black webzine  em  The Root  em  gave the  caste thesis  a  a href  https  www.theroot.comcastefootballtakesupthecauseofwhiteathletes   sympathetic hearing  a   precisely for this reason.  p    p  Blacks are not physically superior . If you believe that they are  you  ve only set yourself up for the devastating counterpunch that whites are mentally superior . Those blows of superiority and inferiority continue to hammer both sides of the racial divide . They must be fought ardently at all times . On and off the field.  p    p  Questions of  superiority  and  inferiority  ultimately miss the point . The issue is difference . And yes  Virginia  race is real . Gene pools are plastic to their environments  and over the millennia   a href  https  www.theroot.comcastefootballtakesupthecauseofwhiteathletes   races  a   that is  breeds or extended families  emerged  having adapted to their surroundings through natural selection . That races existand that some races might  by chance  be better adapted to the artificial environment of a football fieldis simply an implication of Darwinian evolution.  p    p  In   O.J . Simpson  then the star running back for the Buffalo Bills  remarked   p    p  We are built a little differently  built for speedskinny calves  long legs  high asses are all characteristics of blacks.  p    p  O.J . was right  at least about that .  em  Vis√†vis  em  Whites and Asians  West Africans have  p    p  It is beyond naive to believe that such factors would not give Africans major advantages in football . Added to this  Blacks develop faster than Whites  who  in turn  mature faster than Asians  . Black mothers have  a href  https  academic.oup.comijearticle   shorter gestation periods  a    weeks   Blacks babies tend to hold their heads up and sit up sooner in the crib  and Blacks experience puberty at a younger age . Developmental disparity has a major impact in determining which players get recruited for major colleges  and which go on to the next level.  p    p  No surprisingly  the paradigmatic PC scandalin which a mainstream figure was denounced and personally destroyed for expressing an opinioninvolved the anthropology of football.  p    p  In   beloved commentator Jimmy  the Greek  Snyder  a href  https  www.washingtonpost.comarchivepoliticsjimmythegreeksaysblacksarebredforsportsaeeabdade  utmterm.fdbc   observed  a   on Martin Luther King  s birthday  no less   p    p  I  m telling you that the black is the better athlete . . . And he  s bred to be the better athlete because this goes all the way to the Civil WAR when  during the slave trading  the owner  the slave owner  would breed his big woman so that he would have a big black kid  see.  p    p  The huge uproar that resulted occurred precisely because everyone knew that  the Greek  was getting at the truth . And as nutrition  training  and technology reach their limits in allowing athletes to realize their potential  genetic factors are likely to become even more important going forward.  p    p  Among the bestselling  a href  https  www.fanatics.comnfljerseysodz   NFL jerseys  a   White quarterbacks and tight ends  Carson Wentz  Rob Gronkowski  and Tom Brady  et al .  predominateto a degree  no doubt  that embarrasses the league . Tim Tebow and  a href  http  bleacherreport.comarticlesthepeytonhillisstoryfrommaddencovertooutsidelookingin   Peyton Hillis  a   the rare White running quarterback and tailback who could actually compete  became the most popular players in the league almost overnight  before each of their careers crashed and burned . Such things demonstrate the yearning White fans have to root on White playersa yearning that will never be fulfilled in the foreseeable future . Put simply  the NFL is a Black league . It was not always a Black league  but it will be for the duration . So why should we even care   p    p  An amusing and revealing trivia question  Who won the first Heisman Trophy  The answer is  a href  https  en.wikipedia.orgwikiJayBerwanger   Jay Berwanger  a  in  . He is almost completely unknown today . He didn  t attend Notre Dame or Michigan but the University of Chicago  whose athletic fields are  a href  http  www.uchicago.edufeatureshowthefirstchainreactionchangedscience   most famous  a  for being the sites for the development of the atomic bomb . Berwanger was also the first player ever taken in the NFL draft  but he elected not to go pro.  p    p  Only four years later  in   UChicago President  a href  https  www.si.comvaultcollegefootballisaninfernalnuisance   Robert Maynard Hutchins  a  banned football outright  for utterly reactionary reasons   In many colleges  it is possible for a boy to win  letters without learning how to write one.  The team returned in the  s  but in Division III  with athletes who could at least approximate the student body . President Hutchins was a curmudgeon  and a prophet of sorts . But even he could not envision what was to take place at universities over the next halfcenturytheir transformation into entertainment industry.  p    p  The modern university system is a tremendous burden on society  behemoth institutions in which administrators outnumber instructors and students get saddled with lifelong debt in hopes of earning a golden ticket to the middle class . College football isn  t solely to blame for this trend  but it hasn  t helped either . And it makes a mockery of supposed  research institutions  and  colleges of the liberal arts  that act as governmentsubsidized minor leagues for the NFL.  p    p  Beginning in   the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill came under scrutiny after a football player tweeted about partying with a famous sports agent at a lavish Miami nightclub . The investigations uncovered the reality  both sad and hilarious  of life at a  big time  university  classes were effectively daycare sessions for yearold illiterates  random payouts and favors were ubiquitous  socalled  tutors  literally did the reading and writing on behalf of players  and all of it operated through the AfricanAmerican Studies Department.  p    p  The Carolina scandal can ultimately be laughed off . It is shocking only to the most na√Øve  and no one got hurt . The same can not be said of the case involving the  Baylor Bruins   an allfemale  hostess  program for prized recruits at Baylor University . One young woman who joined this program in   Elizabeth Doe  claims at least  rapes were committed by some  Baylor players over the course of four years . A  a href  https  www.washingtonpost.comnewsearlyleadwpbaylormovestodismisslawsuitallegingrapesbyfootballplayers  utmterm.edaeefce   telling quote  a  from these allegations comes from Kendal Briles  an assistant football coach and son of former head coach Art Brile   p    p  Do you like white women  Because we have a lot of them at Baylor  and they love football players.  p    p  Some of the alleged victims were female athletes in other sports  including a volleyball player who  a href  http  www.vdare.compoststhebaylorfootballprogramsblackrapeculturepushedbywhitecoachesandprotectedbywhiteadministrators   claims  a  she was gang raped.  p    p  Baylor first attempted to get the case dismissed . When that failed  it reached a settlement with Elizabeth Doe . Two of the accused players await criminal trials . The head coach  along with his staff  was fired . Chancellor Ken Starr  yes   em  that  em  Ken Starr  resigned under pressure . Needless to say  the football goes on.  p    p  How could anyone really expect such an appalling fiasco not happen somewhere  College athletes are in a legitimately unfair position of being pros who don  t get paid  at least not officially and regularly  . And colleges compete with fringe benefits . And those benefits will include women.  p    p  But again  the deeper question is how football makes people act and think . For those fanatics at Baylor and Carolina  at stake was not just wins and loses and not just school pride . At stake was the myth of the  student athlete   that of racial equality  and the necessity of presenting Southern schools as progressive and morally redeemed . Who wouldn  t fudge some numbers  pass money under the table  and look the other way as a few women get abused for such a righteous cause   p    p  Throughout Middle America and the South  a football coach is a man upheld as a Patton of the gridiron  part field general  part strategic mastermind  part father figure  occasional peptalker and bearhugger . He must be serious and stern  only cracking a smile when carried off the field by his players or doused with Gatorade . The coach is an avatar of an oldschool authoritarian with a warm heart  a figure millions of Whites instinctively admire . The fact that  Coach  is used as a kind of formal appellation  much like  Herr Professor Schmidt  or  President Reagan   speaks to the reverence the profession commands.  p    p  In reality  coaches are closer to being babysitters or  yes  I  ll say it   em  plantation managers  em  . And most are highfunctioning morons  smart enough to understand a wishbone offense and the intricacies of  Cover    but dumb enough to be blissfully unaware of the absurdity of their profession and the terrible impact it has on society . In this regard  listening to Rex Ryan  s  a href  https  nypost.compissedoffrexryanhassomedonaldtrumpregrets   selfrighteous burbling  a  about Donald Trump offers a certain delight.  p    p   span class  embedyoutube  style  textalign  center  display  block     iframe allowfullscreen  true  class  youtubeplayer  height    src  https  www.youtube.comembedJWdIC  version  amp  rel  amp  fs  amp  autohide  amp  showsearch  amp  showinfo  amp  ivloadpolicy  amp  wmodetransparent  style  border   type  texthtml  width      iframe   span   p    p  The  great  coachesnot the Rex Ryans but the legends and iconspossess the personality types of the modern politician  they balance the desire to win at all cost with the need to go with the PC flow  they nod to the values and  em  mores  em  of their White fans  while kowtowing to ownership or their schools   booster  societies . They are never leaders in the true sense of word.  p    p  Paul  Bear  Bryantwhose coaching career    spanned Alabama  s transition from allWhite to  integrated  to majority Black teamsis a classic example in this regard . Shortly before his death  Bryant  a href  http  bleacherreport.comarticleshowbearbryantbecamethebranchrickeyofalabama   claimed  a  that he wanted to be remembered as the  Branch Rickey of football   a reference to the Brooklyn Dodgers General Manager who brought Jackie Robinson into Major League Baseball  . Such a statement can only be read as revisionist delusions of an dying man . Bryant never openly opposed segregationnever went against Governor George Wallace or Alabama  s White fansdespite the fact that he was the most popular man in the state at the time  and despite the fact that he actively wanted to recruit Black players . Alabama was late to integrate even for the Southeastern Athletic Conference  and Bryant is most remembered for his three National Titles in the s won with allWhite Teams.  p    p  On September     Bryant scheduled  at his own discretion  a game against the University of Southern California Trojans  an integrated team with a Black quarterback . Alabama was overmatched physically  and lost by three touchdowns    . There are competing narratives about the event . The first is that a kind of culture clashor race wartook place  in which the bright  integrated future traveled to the benighted Deep South  and won . The other narrative is more complicated . Bryant had already tried to recruit Black athletes and failed  due to the players  own discomforts and pressure from the University . The USC game was thus an opportunity to prove to his fans the necessity of integration . In other words  it was football blackmail   em  Do you want to stay White  Or do you want to win   em  USC players reported that when Bryant went to shake hands with his USC counterpart  John McCay  he came with a beaming smile on his face   John  I can  t thank you enough.  An  a href  https  www.theatlantic.comentertainmentarchivetheintegrationofcollegefootballdidnthappeninonegame   apocryphal legend  a  has it that Bryant brought USC running back Sam Cunningham into the Alabama locker room and presented him to his players   Gentlemen   em  this  em  is a football player.  Whatever the case  the game proved to be a symbolic turning point  for Alabama and all of college football . Dennis Royal  s  University of Texas squad was the last White team to win a National Title . By   Alabama would be integrated  followed by LSU and Ole Miss a year later.  p    p  It is precisely Bryant  s ambiguity that continue to make him a compelling and magisterial figure for millions of football fans . He became a  progressive  without actually risking anything . In turn  his demeanor and airhis grey and plaid suits and checkered and houndstooth fedorasgrant Bryant a proudly conservative presence  even more so than the flamboyant and d√©class√© figures associated with the battles against desegregation . But such a persona ultimately rings hallow when tested . At least genuine leftists openly strove to transform society  institutions  marriage and the family . Bear Bryant wanted Black players in order to beat USC . In turn  fans  adoration of the Great White Coacha Bryant or Bowden or Sabancommanding an allBlack team represents the last gasp of a defeated people   em  At least we have our football   em   p    p  Football was once a midwestern oddity and favorite sport of the Ivy League . Today  it lays claim to being  America  s Game  even more than the onetime  National Pastime   baseball . Baseball is baseball everywhere  from Los Angeles to Mexico City to Tokyo   but  Canadian football  or  Australian football  are different games entirely . Thus  American football has emerged as a civic nationalism  indeed  one of the few things citizens of a multiracial and multicultural republic can claim to hold in common.  p    p   img class  alignnone sizefull wpimage  height    sizes   maxwidth  px  vw  px  src  wpcontentuploadsgettyimages.jpg  srcset  wpcontentuploadsgettyimages.jpg w  wpcontentuploadsgettyimagesx.jpg w  width       p    p  It is thus not surprising that the American military is now a prominent part of the NFL . The NFL has  in fact  dedicated the entire month of November to the U.S. military   Salute To Service    in which players and coaches add camouflage  flair  to the uniforms .  This comes after  a href  http  www.nfl.compink   NFL Pink  a   formerly known as October  in which the NFL requires players to be decked out in girly gloves  towels  and cleats  ostensibly in support of breast cancer awareness .   p    p  None of this is altruistic . Between  and   the Department of Defense spent more than   million on  marketing and advertising contracts with professional sports teams.  Among that  some  . million of taxpayer funding went to  NFL teams . These contracts gave the military the right to present aircraft flyovers  unfurl enormous flags  and hold colorguard ceremonies and even enlistment campaigns at NFL games .  The DoD payouts to the NFL ended in   after much criticism . The monthlong   a href  http  www.nfl.comSalute   Salute to Service  a   continues .   p    p  The military capitalizes on the goodwill generated by football as a communitarian public spectacle . In turn  the NFL has been able to maintain a perpetual    atmosphere  in which attending sports is synonymous with  supporting the troops.  Perhaps the NFL  s symbolic propaganda message is that it is  in fact  another branch of the military.  p    p  There are certainly traditionalist aspects to this connection between the American people  the military  and violent spectacle  in the conservative  s imagination  the military represents a culture of honor and discipline  just as the NFL is a space in which strength and manliness still mean something . But all of this is botched and turned into parody . The military wouldn  t embrace football if it didn  t see it as an opportunity for generating uncritical support for its overseas wars and sprawling industrial complex . And football  in turn  embraces war and the troops in a desperate attempt to cover over its own immense failings . In taking up the anthem controversyand even suggesting the prospect of obligatory patriotismDonald Trump was hardly questioning any of this . He sought  in fact  to reinforce the martial quality of footballand  you could say  this football quality of the military . The ultimate outcome will be quite the opposite  as both industries are experiencing collapse in their public legitimacy.  p    p  We must ask now how these impulses towards manliness  power  and danger might head might be expressed in football  s absense  Football lays claim to being the most badass of sports  crushing hits  terrifying injuries  bodies being laid out on the groundall of this set out for your amusement . And unlike boxing or mixed martial arts  football is a war game  with trenches  helmets  field generals  battles for territory  long bombs  and Hail Marys . Liberals traditionally dislike football for these reasonsit offends their desire to be both individualistic and cooperative.  p    p  Football fandom also appeals to traditionally  male  activities such as eating greasy food  hanging out with  the boys   and drinking beer . The purpose of the  man cave   after all  is to watch sports . And unlike playing video games or watching art films  it doesn  t carry any effeminate connotations . But the manliness of football is precisely why watching it is so insidious . Football offers a substitute manliness  quite literally.  p    p  The right side of the brain possesses  mirror neurons   which help us vicariously experience the actions of others . As one researcher  a href  http  www.medicaldaily.commindandbodysportsfansportsgames   described  a  it   p    p  This phenomenon allows a feeling of connection  and community without verbal communication or the need to directly talk to the pro athlete who just won the World Series with a grand slam.  p    p   Mirroring  is  no question  an essential part of life . Empathy and vicarious experiences allow us to learn from others and enjoy storytelling by projecting ourselves onto the protagonist . But intently watching a game is an experience of the  em  hyperreal  em   similar to having sex by watching Internet porn . On a basic level  the mind doesn  t grasp the difference . HighDefinition images become a virtual reality  and you get off just the same.  p    p   img class  alignnone sizefull wpimage  height    sizes   maxwidth  px  vw  px  src  wpcontentuploadsDraggedImage.png  srcset  wpcontentuploadsDraggedImage.png w  wpcontentuploadsDraggedImagex.png w  wpcontentuploadsDraggedImagex.png w  width       p    p  The benefits of a  tough  sportstrength  courage  comradeship with a teamcome from playing it . Simply watching it  and engaging in activities which make you weaker  makes you a consumer of toughness . I hesitate to extend the metaphor too far  But it would be like saying seducing women is the peak of masculinity  and then spending all day watching pornography with a group of your friends.  p    p  The System doesn  t want us to  em  do  em   it wants us to  em  watch  em  . It doesn  t want us to create but consume  to watch porn  not make love or produce familes . All experience is to be moderated  all value  monetized and commodified  and all community  reduced to brands . Fandom itself is an expression of the  em  loss  em  at the heart of the modern world . Men want to fight and win  be part of a gang  sacrifice for glory  and be rewarded with fame and women .  Even nerds want this  as they gravitate to videogames of war  conquest  chivalry  and violence .   Fandom  is the collective identity the system is willing to offer us.  p    p  Our real task is to create a new culture . And the only way to do that is to  em  just do it  em   to borrow corporate slogan from sports world  . This means spending time with friends and family  playing  not just watching  sports  getting strong  participating in meetups and activism  and building institutions.  p    p  Fandom transforms manly impulsesthe desire for community  the attraction to strength and accomplishment  the wish for spectacleinto weaknesses . And in so doing  transforms White men into sources of revenue for people who despise them.  p    p  So be a man . Stop being a fan.  p    p   MLK Day  has become the high holy day of the American liturgical calendar . No other statesman  not Washington  Jefferson  or Lincoln  is deemed worthy of a holiday all to his own . And no other national holiday seems to carry such relevant  pressing meaning for Americans as the third Monday in January . The th of July has become an excuse for a backyard barbecue .

The MLK anniversary  on the other hand  inspires Americans to ask who we are and what our higher ideals should be.  p    p  NPI  s cofounder   a href  http  www.amren.comfeaturesthekingholidayanditsmeaning   Samuel Francis  a   who was active in the debates about the institution of the holiday in mid  s  recognized then that the significance of Martin Luther King Jr. stretched far beyond the legal and political technicalities of the Civil Right Act . The celebration of the man represented a great change in how Americans understood their nation.  p    p   T  he true meaning of the holiday is that it serves to legitimize the radical social and political agenda that King himself favored and to delegitimize traditional American social and cultural institutions  not simply those that supported racial segregation but also those that support a free market economy  an anticommunist foreign policy  and a constitutional system that restrains the power of the state rather than one that centralizes and expands power for the reconstruction of society and the redistribution of wealth . In this sense  the campaign to enact the legal public holiday in honor of Martin Luther King was a small first step on the long march to revolution  a charter by which that revolution is justified as the true and ultimate meaning of the American identity . In this sense  and also in King  s own sense  as he defined it in his speech at the Lincoln Memorial in   the Declaration of Independence becomes a  promissory note  by which the state is authorized to pursue social and economic egalitarianism as its mission  and all institutions and values that fail to reflect the dominance of equality  racial  cultural  national  economic  political  and social  must be overcome and discarded.  p    p  By placing King  and therefore his own radical ideology of social transformation and reconstruction  into the central pantheon of American history  the King holiday provides a green light by which the revolutionary process of transformation and reconstruction can charge full speed ahead . Moreover  by placing King at the center of the American national pantheon  the holiday also serves to undermine any argument against the revolutionary political agenda that it has come to symbolize . Having promoted or accepted the symbol of the new dogma as a defining  perhaps the defining  icon of the American political order  those who oppose the revolutionary agenda the symbol represents have little ground to resist that agenda.  p    p  Sam is all too correct that  MLK writ large  has become the foundation of American identity  in many ways  the situation is far worse than the one he depicted in .  p    p  At the time  Sam described a pitched battle between MLK  s egalitarian  Dream  and  traditional American social and cultural institutions   which he describes  in Cold War language  as  antiCommunist foreign policy   freemarkets  and the Constitution.  p    p  What Sam might not have grasped in   but understood fully later  is that by the turn of the st century  the MLK counterculture  em  was  em   and  em  is  em   the Establishment . There are precious few  traditional American social and cultural institutions  that do not honor MLK or treat  The Dream  as informing their missions.  p    p  And this is not solely the case for the more overtly liberal ones like the Department of Education . No less a putative bastion of conservative values than the U.S. Army is led by men like FourStar General George Casey  who in   in response to a Muslim Army Major who murdered  of his fellow soldiers as an act of  em  jihad  em   averred   p    p  What happened in Fort Hood was a tragedy . But I believe it would become an even greater tragedy if our Diversity becomes a casualty . And it  s not just about Muslims . We have a very diverse Army  we have a very diverse society  and that gives us all strength.  p    p  MLK unites the Left  tactical disputes between Malcolm X and the pacifist reverend have long since gone by the wayside  . And in a strange way  he  a href  http  twitchy.comamendrbencarsonnailsitwithsimplekeypointonmlkday   unites the Right  a  as well .  Judged By The Content Of Their Character  is the central  if not  em  sole  em   argument against multiculturalism and affirmativeaction offered forth by selfstyled  conservatives.  And King is counted as an American icon and hero not only at leftwing and liberal gatherings but at those of the  Religious Right  and Beltway Republicans.  p    p   a href  altrightarchivealtrightarchivemainblogsdistrictofcorruptiontheglennbeckdeception   Glenn Beck  a  who  in his radio and television programs and  a href  journaltheoldtimereligion   mass rallies  a   has created a kind of religion of MLKmight actually turn Sam  s polemic on its head and claim that MLK  em  is  em  the hero of American foreign policy and Constitutional government . And he would  in a sense  be correcteven in the matter of foreign affairs . Washington  s violent incursions into the Middle East are invariably accompanied by promises that all shall vote  women shall attain undergraduate educations  and minorities shall be empowered.  p    p  Despite conservatives  wishful thinking  The Dreamin all its manifestationsis the antithesis of a free society . Government  s enforcing that all people and businesses make judgments nonracially is  in itself  a totalitarian notion and has  in fact  resulted in a massive interventionist infrastructure and bureaucracy .  Rand Paul tepidly  a href  altrightarchivealtrightarchivemainblogsdistrictofcorruptionwhyrandneedshbd   hinted  a  at as much during his  Senate campaign .  The  a href  http  www.thenationalpolicyinstitute.orgpdfcostofdiversity.pdf   costs  a  of the industry of  civil rights  and  diversity training  in the workplace can be measured in the hundreds of billions  if not trillions  per year .  And  em  pace  em  conservative revisionism  the actual Martin Luther King Jr.  a href  http  www.lewrockwell.comarchivesfm.html   unequivocally advocated  a  most all of the measures done in his name .   p    p  More deeply   nondiscrimination  as a value is the enemy of all tradition  not just the AngloSaxon American society it has helped destroy . The version of The Dream that conservatives likethat of interracial handholding and vague libertarianismis ultimately a vision of raceless  familyless  classless  historyless individuals  happily experiencing equality with other individuals of various shades  all integrated by the marketplace and government . Tradition is  at its root  about being a part of something larger than oneself . The Dream is about becoming a selfcontained atom.  p    p  Conservatives might think it cute to quote some of King  s more libertarian utterances back at liberals  as a form of  PC Judo.

And when someone is the target of criticism  he should not be expected always to agree with it . It is important  however  to comprehend that criticism  to take it seriously on its own terms  and not just dismiss it as inspired by malice  jealousy or ignorance.  p    p  The criticism that the French New Right  NR  has leveled at America has earned it an unjustifiable label of being inspired by some kind of hidden French chauvinism or  antiAmerican  phobia . And too often the New Right  s criticism has been poorly understood . Some Americanswho are themselves critical of what their country has now become and the way it has evolvedassume that the criticism is aimed primarily at the America of today . This is not true . The criticism the NR addresses against America is aimed  in fact  at the very foundation of what we call the  American ideology  an ideology going back to the Founding Fathers . Or to put it differently  this is not a criticism of multiracial  or  multicultural   America of modern and postmodern times  but primarily a criticism aimed at the America created by Whites and AngloSaxon Christians.  p    p  As a way of adding some final touches to Tomislav Sunic  s book  I  d like to outline the general thrust of this criticism.  p    p  Europe has never declared war on the United States . It is clear  however  that from its very beginning  the United States of America has had a score to settle with Europe . America was born out of desire to break up with Europe . What immigrant communities in the New World first and foremost desired was to dispense with the rules and political principles that prevailed in Europe . The American nation was born in a contractual form during the era of modernity  evoking largely the  primal scene  as imagined by Sigmund Freud  the children get together in order to kill their father and afterwards they draft a contract sanctioning the relationship between equals.  p    p  Evidently  the father in that scheme was Europe . It was necessary to make a clean break with the past in order to create a new humankind . Thus  in the  em  Federalist Papers  em  we read   p    p  Had no important step been taken by the leaders of the Revolution for which a precedent could not be discovered  no government established of which an exact model did not present itself  the people of the United States might  at this moment have been numbered among the melancholy victims of misguided councils  must at best have been laboring under the weight of some of those forms which have crushed the liberties of the rest of mankind . Happily for America and we trust for the whole human race  they pursued a new and more noble course . They accomplished a revolution which has no parallel in the annals of human society . They reared the fabrics of governments which have no model on the face of the globe.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  Likewise  it was against Europe that in December  James Monroe stated the central tenet of his famous  Doctrine   that is  that no European intervention should be tolerated at any point whatsoever on the American continent .  We have listened too long to the courtly muses of Europe   exclaimed for his part the poet and philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson in the th century .  In many respects   as Dominique Moisi and Jacques Rupnik remark   p    p  America is antiEurope . It was born out of desire to create a  new Jerusalem  on earth in order to overcome the limitations and errors of the European history.  p    p  Given that U.S. citizenship is founded on a contract between immigrants of diverse origins  it follows that all cultural idiosyncrasies must be relegated into the private sphere  which means that they must be temporarily held outside the notion of citizenship . This requirement perfectly matches with the individualist philosophy of the Founding Fathers . It was in America  for the first time ever  that a society was construed composed exclusively of individuals and not of groups  just as capitalism itself presupposed a brand of individualism oriented first toward the property possession.  p    p  Sometimes the indifference of the Americans toward history is explained by a relative short duration of the existence of their country . This explanation does not sound convincing . After all  two centuries is a long stretch of time . In fact  the problem is not so much that Americans  have no history  but rather that they do not wish to have one . And they do not wish to have one because  for them  the past is reminiscent of their European roots  which they once attempted to discard .  This is the only people without any roots and genealogy   wrote  quite fondly  the liberal author Guy Sorman . Thomas Jefferson expressed the same idea by saying that each generation forms a  separate nation.   The dead   he said   have no rights.  Daniel Boorstin  the former director of the Library of Congress  wrote that  the notion of hyphenated Americans is unAmerican.  p    p  I believe that there are only Americans . PolishAmericans  ItalianAmericans  or AfricanAmericans are an emphasis that is not fertile . Americans prefer to be called by their first names and abandon the names of their heritage . The same applies to objects  the trend being toward the unsustainable and the disposable.  p    p  The same observation was made by Christopher Lasch  who wrote that in the U.S.  the removal of the roots has always been seen as the prerequisite for increased freedoms.  Hence  America can be described as a civilization of space and not a civilization of time . Its founding myth is not the origin  but the frontier  which in  Frederick Jackson Turner interpreted as the most representative notion of the American ideal  that is  the aspiration toward  the conquest of space.   What other people experience as history   observes JeanPaul Doll√©   the Americans perceive as a sign of underdevelopment.   p    p  And the Americans did not wish to break up with only Europe . They also wanted to create a new society that would regenerate mankind . They wanted to create a new  promised land  that would become the model of the Universal Republic . This Bibleinspired theme  based on the idea of the  chosen  America  has  from its outset and by a purported divine choice  constituted the foundation of a  civil religion  and of American  exceptionalism.  It has kept resurfacing as a leitmotif throughout American history  ever since the days of the Pilgrims  as for instance when the Massachusetts Bay theologian John Cotton suggested the adoption of Hebrew as the official language for the former British colonies . John Winthrop  the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony  which was founded in   asserted   p    p  We must always consider that we shall be as a city upon a hillthe eyes of all people are upon us . Today the eyes of all people are truly upon usand our governments  in every branch  at every level  national  state and local  must be as a city upon a hill.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  Similar statements were made by William Penn  the chief of the Quaker colony of future Pennsylvania  only to be echoed by the settlers of Virginia .

And also to continue to proceed in a manner that would eventually lead the whole world to impregnate itself with the idea that the American society is the perfect society and that the descendants of the Puritans are God  s elect . Besides  it is the Puritan theology of the  covenant  that inspired the doctrine of Manifest Destiny  as put forward by John L. O  Sullivan in    p    p  Our national birth was the beginning of a new history  the formation and progress of an untried political system  which separates us from the past and connects us with the future only  and so far as regards the entire development of the natural rights of man  in moral  political  and national life  we may confidently assume that our country is destined to be the great nation of futurity . Who  then  can doubt that our country is destined to be the great nation of futurity   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  In other words  if God had chosen to favor the Americans  they should be entitled to convert other peoples whichever way they see best and most expedient.  p    p  Hence  on the one hand we are witnessing isolationismAmerica must separate itself from the outside world  which is seen as corrupt . On the other hand  there is a need for the  crusade  the world must gradually be penetrated with the universal values of the American system . In economics  freetrade policies have never prohibited the use of protectionism  whenever this was deemed necessary  similarly  in foreign policy  isolationism  coupled with the spirit of  crusade   can march hand in hand . These are the two sides of the same messianic vocation and a typical example of how political universalism is just a mask for ethnocentrism  that is to say  a peculiar model with planetary ambitions.  p    p  This underlying certitude explains the extraordinary stability of the U.S. system . In the course of its history  the United States has known only one important political model  a model which has virtually remained unchanged ever since the days of the Founding Fathers . The Constitution  largely inspired by Locke  and generally speaking by the philosophy of Enlightenment  and vetted through Puritanism  has become a sort of sacred monument that makes of Americanism a genuine religion . Be they on the right or on the left  all Americans are in agreement that they have a mission to spread  the word  to mankind . Even the most frenzied utopians do not call into question the authority of the Constitution or the superiority of individual initiative . The system can be tentatively improved or reformed  but it must be remain fundamentally unchanged  insofar as it meshes with the very existence of the country . Whereas in Europe it is still possible to refer to some of the countless political models that existed in the past  the political debate in America reduces itself to discussions about the relative merits of Hamilton  Jefferson  Washington  et al . Fascism and Communism have never had any real impact on the United States  nor has the idea of counterrevolution  nor critical Marxism  nor revolutionary syndicalism  nor anarchosyndicalism  situationism  etc . At universities  Political Science courses often evolve around long discussions about the work of the Founding Fathers  who are portrayed as people of unsurpassable legacy . Even the eternal debate between Federalists and Antifederalists  between the Hamiltonians and the Jeffersonians  is  in fact  a family feud  which never calls into question the underlying political consensus.  p    p  American domestic politics is often reduced to a competition between the two major parties  which in the eyes of the Europeans say more or less the same thing . Electoral competitions  with their conventions organized as circus shows  are entirely dependent on money .  Democracy  in America equals financial oligarchy . The elections are financial effusions of the billionaire class . For the Americans  it is considered natural that politicians must be richin my view  society should be extremely skeptical of anyone who is rich and powerful at the same timejust as it is natural for the politicians to exhibit their wives and children in public meetings  while multiplying religious slogans in their speeches . In continental Europe  a headofstate addressing his constituents with  God bless you   and inviting the parliamentarians to a day of prayer and fasting would be viewed by many as a person ripe for the mental asylum . . .  p    p  The flip side of this institutional paralysis is formidable conformism and extraordinary monotony of a society that  decade after decade  asserts  with the same docile conviction  that America is a  free country   while adhering to the same modes  abiding by the same conventions  repeating the same slogans  and  of course  wearing the same uniforms  jeans and T shirts with a logo of a university that one never attended or a baseball team of which one is not a member  . This monotony was already described by Alexis de Tocqueville  who noted that the sequence of commotion and fleeting fashions never augur anything new in America . About the same time the Countess of Merlin also remarked that life of the Americans is  an eternal course in geometry.   p    p  The same messianic certitude inspires American foreign policy  whose main principle is that what is good for America must also be good for the rest of the worldwhich  in turn  must allow America to expect from its allies financial contributions and applause . As a secularized guise of the Puritan ideal  foreign policy is based on the idea that only the lack of information or the intrinsic evil of foreign leaders explains the reluctance of people around the world to embrace the American way of life . As Jean Baudrillard wrote  the United States is a society  p    p  whose naivet√© can be described as unbearable and whose fixed idea is that America is the perfect completion of everything that others dream about.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p   International relations  is nothing but a global diffusion of the American ideal on the planetary level . Since they assume that they represent the model of perfection  American do not feel obliged to get to know others . It remains for others to adopt the American way .  The tradeoff is uneven   observes Thomas Molnar   because America has nothing to learn but everything to teach.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  And indeed  everything that happens in America must eventually happen elsewhere in the world . In other words  foreign policy has for a goal the creation of unified humanity no longer in need of any foreign policy . Under such circumstances one must not be surprised that setbacks encountered by the United States in the international arena are often the results of America  s inability to comprehend that other peoples think differently than they do . In fact  for the Americans  the external world   the rest of the world   simply does not exist  or rather it exists in so far as it becomes Americanizeda necessary precondition to become comprehensible.  p    p  Many observers have noticed the importance of religion in the American society .  In God we trust  is written on all banknotes  and since   it has become a national motto . In the United States  almost all official ceremonies are preceded or followed by a prayer . As of   the Reverend J.B. Soames declared in Washington  during a solemn blessing of the military equipment   If Jesus Christ came back to Earth he would be white  American and proud of it   Tocqueville already observed   p    p  It is the religion that gave birth to the AngloAmerican societies . One must never forget this  in the United States  religion is therefore intermingled with all the national habits and all the sentiments to which a native country gives birth.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  Religion is often redefined in an optimistic sense  consistent with the requirements of practical materialism and aspirations of the people who has never ceased to believe in the virtues of technology and who spontaneously assumegiven that the sense of the tragic is alien to itthat somehow things will always sort themselves out in the end . The well known American professor Thomas L. Pangle  in his study on Montesquieu and his influence on the Founding Fathers  suggests the adoption of liberal  commercial republicanism and the spirit of commerce as the best regime  p    p  fundamentally opposed  not only to insecurity  but also to both the austere civic virtue of republican antiquity and to religious selftranscendence or otherworldliness.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  The bottom line is the reconciliation of religion with optimism inherited from the Enlightenment and embedded in the direction pointing toward the future and the mystique of progress . From John Winthrop to George W. Bush and Barack Obama  the Americans have never given up on the belief in progress  which often leads them to the conclusion that material and technological developments will also bring about the betterment of mankind . In this world of ours  only through the hoarding of material goods can a person be saved . Hence the idea of  redemption  through the conversion to the American way of life . Calvinism had already tried to solve this problem of  predestination  by interpreting material success as a sign of divine election . The glorification of individual performance  the spirit of capitalism  the pacifying virtues of  smooth trade   all of this nurtures hopes that the accumulation of wealth will someday erase all evil . Evil becomes a  mistake   a state of imperfection that must be eventually surpassed by increased trade and economic  development.  From now on  it is no longer ethics that justify interests but interest that attempt to justify ethics . In his letter of   addressed to Thomas Law  Jefferson wrote   The answer is that nature has constituted utility to man the standard and best of virtue.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  One hundred years later  Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes added   p    p  the best test of truth is the power of thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market  and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  It seems that in America truth has become a commercial issue.  br  Televangelists preach the  prosperity gospel  getting rich is a sign of getting savedbefore making their constant fundraising appeals.  p    p  The Puritans had retained from Locke the idea that all other human rights derive from  natural right of property.  For Madison   the first goal of the government  is to ensure the acquisition of property . In   he said  In a word  as a man is said to have a right to his property  he may be equally said to have a property in his rights.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  Rights are interpreted as inherent attributes of human nature  something that individuals possess because of their membership to the human species  and it is those rights that governments are bound to  ensure.   p    p  The New Right totally rejects this notion of subjective rights  which are absolutely opposed to the traditional notion of objective law . In this view  law is an equity relationship  enabling everyone to get what he deserves . Similarly  the New Right rejects the idea that private property must be an absolute.  p    p  Such an idea of man was inherent to the foundations of a society  aptly described by Ezra Pound as a  purely commercial  br  civilization.  His words echo Tocqueville  s   p    p  The passions that agitate the Americans most profoundly are commercial passions and not political passions  or rather  they carry the habits of trade into politics.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  America is certainly not the first commercial republic in history  but it is the first one to have posited that nothing whatsoever should limit economic activities  as it is the cherished means of achieving the betterment of all mankind . Being on his own  the individual counts in so much as his external activity keeps growing . Naturally  only his economic performance will properly measure his worth .  In America   wrote Hermann Keyserling   people really believe that the rich are superior simply because they have money  in America  having money creates  in fact  moral rights.   p    p  Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno observed from their perspective   p    p  Here in America  there is no difference between a man and his economic fate . A man is made by his assets  income  position  and prospects . The economic mask coincides completely with a man  s inner character . Everyone is worth what he earns and earns what he is worth.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  .  p    p  Capitalist competition represents the most ethical tribunal  the rich are the  winners   and the  winners  are the righteous . This is the primacy of civilization of  em  having  em  over the civilization of  em  being  em  .  p    p  Such traits do not lend themselves to meditative thinking and inner reflection . When the link to others is solely nurtured by the respect for material goods and the Dollar Almighty  the result is alienation with no bounds . For the Americans  notes Ana√Øs Nin in his diary   it is a sin to have an inner life.  These words may sound excessive  yet they reflect the same conclusions made by the American Christopher Lasch . In the United States there is a consistent trend to believe that intelligence must be reduced to technical knowledge and that the fixation on economic matters should help dispense with the world of pure ideas . Whoever attempts to express an original and profound idea runs the risk of encountering the answer    em  Don  t be so negative . Keep it practical  Stay positive   em    p    p  For the Founding Fathers  the purpose of the government was to ensure the  inalienable rights  of individuals who were  created equal.  Thusly  political life was reduced to morality and law . The American dissident HL Mencken quipped that the very opposite was true   p    p  The worst government is the most moral . One composed of cynics is often very tolerant and humane . But when fanatics are on top  there is no limit to oppression.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  In the United States  political action must always begin with a sudden surge of moral awareness   Something must be done about it     which invariably leads to a  technical  examination of the subject matter under consideration . The law itself is a mode of expression that sets legal forms of moral characteristics inherent to the ideology of human rights . Hence  the extraordinary importance of lawyers in American politics  which Michel Crozier calls the  delirium of the proceedings  and  legal madness.  Meanwhile  the intrinsic superiority of private over public life must be loudly declared everywhere   civil society  over the world of politics  business and economic competition over the common good .  An American  be he a government official or man on the street   writes Thomas Molnar   is convinced that politics as such is a bad thing and that people need to find something else in order to communicate and establish peaceful relations.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  As I stated above  the Americans are inclined to think that evil could disappear and that it is possible to remove the tragic trait of human existence . That is why they want to abolish politics  while at the same time bring history to an end .  America was constructed in order that it can exit history   wrote Octavio Paz . The American  neoconservative  Francis Fukuyama believed to be  br  able to announce its end.  p    p  Waging war has always meant for the Americans a morality  crusade.  This is why it is not enough for them to obtain military victory only . They must also annihilate the enemy  who is invariably depicted not as a leader or state that happens to be an adversary but as the incarnation of evil . Under the guise of  humanitarian intervention  or battles against  terrorists   American wars are always  just wars   that is to say   em  justa causa  em  warsand not wars against a  em  justus hostis  em    just enemy   . Hence  the enemy must be invariably described not just as the enemy of the moment  who could eventually also become an ally in the future   but as a criminal who deserves punishment and reeducation.  p    p  The differences seem to be profound between the political thought in the continental Europe and the American mentality  marked by an economic  commercial and procedural view of the world  by the omnipresence of biblical values  as well as by technological optimism  contractualism  the language of  rights   and the belief in progress.  p    p  I think I know the United States well  as I have sojourned there on many occasions . I have travelled in all directions  from Washington  DC  to Los Angeles  from New Orleans to Key Largo  from San Francisco to Atlanta  from New York to Chicago . I have  of course  come across a number of things that I enjoyed very much . Americans are friendly and welcoming  even if human relationship is often superficial  . They have a tangible sense of community . Their biggest universities offer working conditions that the Europeans could only dream about . I can  t forget the influence that American movies had on me at a time when they were not limited to special effects or superhero nonsense . Especially impressive for me were American literature figures such as Mark Twain  Edgar Allan Poe  Herman Melville  John Steinbeck  Ernest Hemingway  John Dos Passos  William Faulkner  et al . But I also detect the reverse side of the  American way of life   culture viewed as perishable commodities  or as  entertainment   a technomorphic conception of human life designed to transform people into extended remote controlled terminals or computers  fake gender relations  automobile civilization and commercial architecture  there is more genuine sociability at an African local market than at an American supermarketa prime symbol of Western nihilism   obese children groomed by television  glorification of  winners  and the obsession with consumption  fast food  a mixture of Puritans decrees and hysteric transgressions  hypocrisy  corruption  etc . Yes  I am aware of the risk of being accused of bias . But I must admit that for the America of  golden boys   of  rednecks   of  bodybuilders  and  bimbos   of the  American dream  and cheerleaders  of  money makers  and  brokers  on Wall Street  I have no sympathy at all.  p    p  Is globalism today synonymous with Americanism  One is tempted to answer in the affirmative . The fact is that the United States has never stopped exporting its problems to the rest of the world  starting with Europe . In the opinion polls  hostility towards globalization is often accompanied by the rejection of American hegemony . Politically and culturally  globalization largely means a process of Americanization  as the dominant superpower continues to exports its merchandise  its capital  its services  its technology  but also its  industry of the imaginary   its culture  its language  its standards of living and its own worldview.  p    p  But instead of Americanization  should it not be more appropriate to speak of  Westernization   Many Americans consider themselves  Westerners  with some of them even using the term  The West  as a synonym of the  white world   politically a meaningless expression  .  p    p  Etymologically   The West  is a place where the sun sets  a place where things perish  and where history comes to an end . In the past  this term designated one of the two empires   em  pars occidentalis  em   born out of the dismemberment of the Roman Empire . Subsequently  the term became synonymous of the  Western civilization.  Today  like many other terms  it is in the process of taking on an economic aura as Western countries are primarily designed as  developed  countries . This is not a term  however  that I myself use in a positive sense . In my view   The West  has now become the vehiclein contrast to Europeof a social model that has become a mirror image of nihilism . During my travels around the world  I have witnessed what happens to rooted cultures when they are affected by  The West   traditions quickly turn into folklore for tourists  the social bond is undone  the folkways become utility oriented  the American language and the music permeate the mind  and the passion for money becomes overwhelming.  p    p  It is often understood by the expression  The West  the aggregate composed of the United States of America and Europe . But this aggregate  provided that it has ever existed  is already crumbling  as was noted some years ago by Immanuel Wallerstein.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote      a   sup  The transatlantic gap widens every day more and more . Globalization  while exacerbating competition  reveals profound divergences between European interests and American interests . On the geopolitical level  the divergences are even more glaringthe United States is a maritime power  whereas Europe is a continental power .

It is also in the United States that the concept of  governance  was bornfirstly applied to business and then to political and social life . It must not come as a surprise that since   the U.S. economy has become the central stage of the international financial system . It was the United States that established in  the Internatioanl Monetary Fund  IMF  and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  GATT   succeeded in  by the World Trade Organization  WTO .  Those were the institutions that liberated capital movements in  in order to finance America  s deficits . In the realm of financial capital  America still retains a much higher share compared to its industrial sector . It sets the rules for international trade  whereas its monetary policies remain the chief mechanism of regulating the financial accumulation across the globe.  p    p  Just like many Europeans  I am amazed that America  s selftitled  conservatives  defend  almost without exception  a capitalist system whose expanded methodically destroys everything that they supposedly wish to conserve . Despite the structural crisis that the capitalist system has experienced over the last couple of years  American conservatives continue to celebrate capitalism as a system that allegedly respects and guarantees individual freedom  private property  and free trade . They believe in the intrinsic virtues of the market  whose mechanism they cherish as a paradigm of all social relations . They believe that capitalism has something to do with democracy and freedom . They believe in the the necessity of perpetual economic growth . They think that consumption equals happiness and that  more  is synonymous with  better.   p    p  Capitalism  however  is not  conservative.  It is the very opposite of it . Karl Marx already observed that the dismantlement of feudalism and the eradication of traditional cultures and values are the result of capitalism  which  in turn  drowns everything in the  icy water of egotistical calculation.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  Today  the capitalist system  more than ever before  is poised toward the overaccumulation of capital . It needs more trade outlets  more and more markets  and more and more profit . Well  such a goal can not be achieved unless everything that stands in its way is dismantled  starting with collective identities . A fullfledged market economy can not operate in a sustained manner unless people first internalize a fashionable culture  consumption  and unlimited growth . Capitalism can not transform the world into a vast marketwhich  to be sure  is its main objectiveunless the planet is flattened and all people renounce their symbolic imaginations and continues to indulge in a fever for the endless accumulation of something new.  p    p  This is the reason why capitalism  in its attempt to erase borders  is also a system that has turned out to be far more effective and far more destructive than Communism . The reason for this is that the economic logic places profit above everything else . Adam Smith wrote that the merchant has no homeland other than the territory where he makes the biggest profit . It is this logic of the commodity  inspired often by the United States of America  which the New Right firmly opposes.  p    p  March    br  Paris  France  p    p   em  Translated from the French by Tomislav Sunic  em   p    p  This essay serves as the Introduction to Tomislav Sunic  s Homo Americanus  A Child of the Postmodern Age  Second  Revised Edition   published in December by Radix .

This is unfortunate  because  just as in one  s personal life  it  s wise at least to know how others see you  and especially so if the other is a keen observer.  p    p  Tomislav Sunic is such an observer . As someone who has lived under Communism and has seen firsthand the workings of state terror  he is in a unique position to describe the current slide of America into what he aptly terms  soft totalitarianism.  This regime is maintained less by brute force than by an unrelenting  enormously sophisticated  and massively effective campaign to contain political and cultural activity within very narrow boundaries . Dissenters are not trundled off to jail or beaten with truncheons  but are quietly ignored and marginalized . Or they are held up to public disgrace and  wherever possible  removed from their livelihoods.  p    p  The regime is maintained by a consensus that has become part of the furniture of life  repeated endlessly in the major media and reassuringly affirmed by wiselooking professors at prestigious universities . To dissent from this consensus removes one from the mainstream and stigmatizes one as immoral and quite possibly suffering from a psychiatric disorder . One immediately thinks of attitudes on immigration . Even the most fearless mainstream opponents of immigration restrict their opposition to illegal immigrants and are careful to couch their arguments in economic or cultural  but never ethnic or racial  terms.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  One simply can not mention in polite company that the end result of this massive influx of peoples into the traditional homelands of European peoples will be displacement  a decline in their power  and ultimately  perhaps  their disappearance as an identifiable people . But there are a host of other issues that are at least as untouchable as immigration.  p    p  Soft totalitarian regimes can only be maintained by a sense of moral and intellectual legitimacythe willing assent of the vast majority of the people . Without this legitimacy  the entire apparatus of cultural control either disintegrates or transforms into hard totalitarianismthe truncheons and the gulags . But here there is a major difference between Communism in Eastern Europe and the current cultural regime in the United States . As Sunic notes   Behind the Communist semantics in Eastern Europe  there loomed a makebelieve system nobody truly believed in and which everybody  including former Communist party dignitaries  made fun of in private . In America  by contrast  many serious people  politicians  and scholars  let alone the masses  believe in . . . the message of the media.  The people who dissent from the American consensus have been successfully relegated to the fringes . The gods are still worshiped.  p    p  Sunic sees quite clearly that this moral and intellectual legitimacy is fundamentally the result of the triumph of the left as a result of World War II . This transformation occurred first in Western Europe  which has now mostly moved well beyond soft totalitarianism to the beginnings or a gulag system where there are formal legal sanctions for thought crimes . The thought crimes  enforced by liberal and conservative European governments alike  are designed to enforce the dogmas of leftist orthodoxy  most notably everything related to multiculturalism  race  immigration  and the Holocaust . Even in England  the  em  font et origo  em  of American democracy  academics are removed for stating their beliefs on scientific evidence on race differences in intelligence or criminality .  For example  in  Frank Ellis of the University of Leeds was suspended for statements supporting race differences in intelligence .     Legal sanctions enforce orthodoxies in the area of multiculturalism and anything having to do with the fascist past.  p    p  In searching for the origins of this phenomenon  one must begin  as Sunic does  by describing the forcible imposition of leftist ideology and institutions in Germany and France after World War II . As a psychologist  I am always tempted to see the origins of leftist ideological hegemony solely in psychological termsto wonder what incredible psychological defect would lead to a whole people to adopt an ideology in which they were cast as having a grave moral or psychiatric defect . But first and foremost  the triumph of the left in Europe was accomplished via a purge and reeducation of intellectuals  educators  and media figures.  p    p  As Sunic notes  the most obvious beneficiaries of this sea change were the major leftist ideologies of the th century  Marxism  psychoanalysis  and the Frankfurt School . Since much of my writing deals with Jewish issues  I can  t help noting that these ideologies have in common that they are all part of the  Culture of Critique   Intellectual and political movements originated and dominated by Jews and intended by their Jewish participants as advancing Jewish interests  such as ending antiSemitism.  p    p  Any claim that an intellectual or political movement is or was a  Jewish  movement immediately raises all kinds of red flags for most readers . Just as the ethnic interests of Europeans can not be mentioned in discussing the effects of immigration  the Jewish identifications and commitments of the people who originated and disseminated these ideas has been moved to the fringes of intellectual discourse.  p    p  But research in the ethnic motivations of people is perfectly respectable . No one would be surprised if Mexican activists proudly and explicitly advocated the interests of Mexicans in immigration and affirmative action . Nor are we surprised if Jewish activists promoted the interests of Israel . By the same logic  we shouldn  t be surprised if Jewish social scientists are motivated by their ethnic interests . It is an empirical question that can be investigated like any other question in the social sciences  and I think that the data confirms the hypothesis that the Jews who were central to the origins and influence of these movements had a strong Jewish identification and were motivated by their ethnic interests.  p    p  As usual  there is a double standard here . It is a routine for scientists like Arthur Jensen  J. Philippe Rushton  or Richard Lynn to be called  racists  when they call attention to the biological roots of race differences in intelligence or criminality . And my writing on how Jews have pursued their ethnic interests in the intellectual and political arena has been termed  antiSemitism  on more than one occasion.  p    p  Implicitly  the charge of racism or antiSemitism assumes that these writers are nothing more than ethnic activists and that their claims of scientific truth are nothing more than a fig leaf covering their ethnic interestsexactly the claim that I am making about the role of Jews in the triumph of Marxism  psychoanalysis  and the Frankfurt School.  p    p  Unfortunately  the people making these charges of  racism  and  antiSemitism  typically feel no need to dispute the scientific accuracy of the theories they are trying to discredit or even try to provide evidence of ethnic motivation of the scientists involved . Simply making the charge is sufficient . Such is the power of the Left.  p    p  Sunic is quite correct in directing most of his attention to the Frankfurt School . The Frankfurt School developed a devastatingly effective ideology that continues to reverberate in the contemporary world  even after the fall from grace of Communism and psychoanalysis.  p    p  Fundamentally the Frankfurt School attempted to develop an ideology that pathologized National Socialism . National Socialism was  first and foremost  a movement of ethnic cohesion  because of this fact  the Frankfurt School called into question  em  all  em  sources of cohesion of Western societies  Family  religion  culture  and raceethnicity . From the beginning  there was a rejection of valuefree social science research   the fetishism of facts   in favor of the fundamental priority of a moral perspective  in which Western societies were to be transformed into utopias of cultural pluralism.  p    p  According to the Frankfurt School ideology  Europeans who identify with family  nation  or race suffer from a psychiatric disorder . In the ideal Frankfurt School world  Western nations would become therapeutic states . They would be dedicated to rooting out the remnants of adherence to traditional cultural forms of family  nation  religion  and race in their citizens . And they would do so in the interests of promoting mental health  not to mention moral rectitude.  p    p  The basic logic pursued by the Frankfurt School stemmed from the fact that positive attitudes toward church  community  nation  and race tend to result in negative attitudes toward people from different religions  communities  nations  and races . As a result  successful families that inculcate family pride in their children were seen by the Frankfurt School as sources of pathology . For example   em  The Authoritarian Personality  em  a major work of the Frankfurt School intended for an American audienceclaimed that expressions of family pride were  a setting off of a homogeneous totalitarian family against the rest of the world.   p    p  In this upsidedown world  families that are proud of their ancestors  concerned with moving up socially  or even having biological heirs are viewed as pathological.In fact  one might conclude that the real agenda of  em  The Authoritarian Personality  em  is to pathologize adaptive behavior in general . Those who value highly committed marriages and cohesive families  who are upwardly mobile and seek material resources  who are proud of their families and identify with their parents  who have high selfconcepts  who believe that Christianity is a positive moral force and a spiritual consolation  who strongly identify as males or females  but not both    and who are socially successful and wish to emulate paragons of social success  e.g.  American heroes  are viewed as having a psychiatric disorder.  p    p  On the other hand  those who are socially isolated  who have negative and rebellious attitudes toward their families  who are ambivalent and insecure in their sexual identities  who have low selfesteem  who are filled with debilitating insecurities and conflicts  including insecurities about whether their parents loved them   who are moving downward in social status  and who have negative attitudes toward high social status and acquisition of material resources are viewed as the epitome of psychological health.  p    p  Psychoanalysisthat other pillar of th century leftism and the culture of critique was obviously an ideal vehicle for creating the upsidedown world of Frankfurt School ideology . A central feature of psychoanalysis is the idea that surface appearances can often overlay deep unconscious desires and conflicts . And since psychoanalysis never required any empirical evidence for such claims  it essentially allowed the Frankfurt School authors to make up any story they wanted . If the family relationships of ethnocentric subjects were very positive  Frankfurt School theorists could interpret them as surface affection  masking deep  unconscious hostilities toward their parents . Any shred of negative feelings by ethnocentric subjects toward their parents then became a lever they could use to create an imaginary world of suppressed hostility masked by surface affection.  p    p  Yet when another volume of  em  Studies in Prejudice  em  found that antiSemites had poor relationships with their parents  the results were taken at face value.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  The result was not science  but it was effective in achieving its political goals.  p    p  It is not difficult to suppose that the entire program of research of  em  The Authoritarian Personality  em  involved deception from beginning to end . This is suggested by the authors  clear political agenda and the pervasive double standard in which ethnocentrism and involvement in cohesive groups are seen as symptoms of psychopathology among nonJews  whereas Jews are simply viewed as victims of irrational Gentile pathologies and no mention is made of Jewish ethnocentrism or allegiance to their own group.  p    p  Although it is difficult to assess the effect of works like  em  The Authoritarian Personality  em  on the culture of the West  there can be little question that the thrust of this work  as well as other works inspired by psychoanalysis and its derivatives  was to pathologize adaptive behavior in general . Good parenting  upward social mobility  pride in family  religion  nation  and race were all suspect.Many of the central attitudes of the s countercultural revolution find expression in  em  The Authoritarian Personality  em   including idealizing rebellion against parents  uncommitted sexual relationships  and scorn for upward social mobility  social status  family pride  Christianity  and patriotism.  p    p  Viewed at its most abstract level  the fundamental agenda of the Frankfurt School is to influence European peoples to view concern about their own demographic and cultural eclipse as irrational and as an indication of psychopathology . People who do not identify with the basic social categories of family  religion  nation  or race would not be concerned with their demise.  p    p  In the aftermath of the Second World War  many values akin to those of  em  The Authoritarian Personality  em  were imposed on Germans though the U.S. military and occupying powers . However  the success of the Frankfurt School  and other varieties of leftist orthodoxy  do not stem solely from their adoption by governments and authorities . After all  this forcible imposition did not happen in the United States or other areas of Europe.  p    p  In the absence of a conquering army  another important source of influence  at least in America  is what one might term the Jewish intellectual and activist infrastructure of the postWorld War II era . Despite its scientific weakness  the ideology that positive attitudes about family  nation  and race resulted from disturbed parentchild relationships was promulgated by the most prestigious institutions throughout the West  and especially by elite universities and the mainstream media  as the essence of scientific objectivity.  p    p  One aspect of this effort was the production of a great many other writings that reinforced the basic ideas found in  em  The Authoritarian Personality  em  and other works of the Frankfurt School . This general intellectual onslaught is important because it produced a zeitgeist that was far more effective than one or two works by isolated authors.  p    p  A good example is  em  The Politics of Unreason  em     . This volume was part of the Patterns of American Prejudice series funded by the AntiDefamation League of B  nai B  rith and written by Seymour Martin Lipset and Earl Raab .  Raab and Lipset also wrote Prejudice and Society  published by the AntiDefamation League in  .   p    p  First and foremost  we see the close relationship between Jewish activist organizations and academic writing on ethnic relations . In the same way  the  em  Studies in Prejudice  em  series that produced  em  The Authoritarian Personality  em  was funded by the American Jewish Committee . Obviously  there is a link between academic research on ethnic relations and Jewish activist organizations like the AJC and the ADL . Raab  s career has combined academic scholarship with deep involvement as a Jewish ethnic activist . He was associated with the ADL and is Executive Director Emeritus of the Perlmutter Institute for Jewish Advocacy at Brandeis University . He was also a columnist for the San Francisco  em  Jewish Bulletin  em  .  p    p   em  The Politics of Unreason  em  analyses political and ideological expressions of ethnocentrism by Europeanderived peoples as irrational and as being unrelated to legitimate ethnic interests in retaining political power . Movements aimed at retaining or restoring the power of the Europeanderived majority of the United States are labeled  rightwing extremism.  Their politics is  the politics of despair.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  For Lipset and Raab  tolerance of cultural and ethnic pluralism is a defining feature of democracy  so that groups that oppose cultural and ethnic pluralism are by definition extremist and antidemocratic.  p    p   em  The Politics of Unreason  em  may therefore be seen as an argument that the European peoples in the United States and other areas of the Western world should not resist declines in their cultural and demographic dominance .  Analogous arguments rarely seem to surface among Jews contemplating whether Israel should remain a Jewish state .  Attempts by majorities to resist the increase in the power and influence of other groups are contrary to  the fixed spiritual center of the democratic political process.  Extremism is antipluralism . . . . And the operational heart of extremism is the repression of difference and dissent.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p   Rightwing extremism  is also condemned because of its populist tendenciesits distrust of institutions that intervene between the people and their direct exercise of power . Indeed  in the postWorld War II era   em  The Authoritarian Personality  em  was an important ideological weapon against historical American populist movements  especially McCarthyism.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p   T  he people as a whole had little understanding of liberal democracy and . . . important questions of public policy would be decided by educated elites  not submitted to popular vote.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  The conclusion of this analysis is that democracy is identified not with the power of the people to pursue their perceived interests . Rather  government is to be the province of morally and intellectually superior elites who have no commitment to the ethnic interests of the European majority  in an Orwellian turn   democracy  is defined as guaranteeing that majorities will not resist the expansion of power of minorities even if that means a decline in their own power.  p    p  The moral and intellectual elite established by these movements dominated intellectual discourse during a critical period after the Second World War and leading into the countercultural revolution of the s . As a result  college students during this period were powerfully socialized to adopt liberalradical cultural and political beliefs . These effects continue into the present era.  p    p  The importance of the intellectual infrastructure can also be seen with other intellectual and political movements . Neoconservatism illustrates the common features of this intellectual infrastructure  It has been championed by a welldefined group of mainly Jewish authors writing with shared assumptions  a common institutional base in universities and thinktanks  access to major media  and mutual admiration.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  The power of the movement comes not from the work of a few individuals but from its dissemination in the media  its legitimacy in the universities  its promotion by Jewish activist organizations  and its constant repetition in slightly different forms and for different audiences by likeminded intellectuals and writers.  p    p  However  this intellectual infrastructure did not occur in a political vacuum . Also of critical importance was the  intergroup relations movement   which was dedicated to passing legislation and disseminating these ideas in the schools . The Frankfurt School was a critical part of the intellectual justification for the  intergroup relations movement  in its effort to  eliminate prejudice and discrimination against racial  ethnic  and religious minorities  in the period following World War II.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  The intergroup relations movement was a multifaceted effort  ranging from legal challenges to racial bias in housing  education  and public employment  legislative proposals and efforts to secure their passage into law in state and national legislative bodies  efforts to shape messages in the media  educational programs for students and teachers  and intellectual efforts to reshape the intellectual discourse of academia.  p    p  As with the other movements with strong Jewish involvement  Jewish organizations  particularly the American Jewish Committee  the American Jewish Congress  and the AntiDefamation League  were the leaders . These organizations provided the major sources of funding  devised the tactics  and defined the objectives of the movement.  p    p  As was also the case with the movement to open up the United States to immigration from all areas of the world  a conscious aim of the intergroup relations movement was to prevent the development of a mass antiJewish movement in the United States  Jewish activists  p    p  saw their commitment to the intergroup relations movement as a preventive measure designed to make sure  it  the Nazis  war of extermination against European Jewrynever happened in America.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  A consistent theme emphasized the benefits to be gained by increased levels of intergroup harmony . But there was no mention that some groups  particularly Europeanderived  nonJewish groups  would lose economic and political power and decline in cultural influence.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  Based on the writings of the Frankfurt School  the intergroup relations movement disseminated the ideology that ethnocentrism and discrimination against outgroups was a mental disease and thus literally a public health problem . The assault on negative attitudes toward other groups was likened to the medical assault on deadly infectious diseases . People with the disease were described by activists as  infected   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  and terms like  virulent antiSemitism  were invented . Negative attitudes toward groups were viewed not as the result of competing group interests but rather as the result of individual psychopathology.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  The story of the Frankfurt School and the intergroup relations movement are paradigmatic examples of Jews producing formidable  effective groupsgroups able to have powerful  transformative effects on the peoples they live among . In the modern world  these traits of Jewish groups have resulted in great influence on the academic world  the political process  and the world of mainstream and elite media . In my book The Culture of Critique and monograph on neoconservatism  I have identified several influential Jewish intellectual and political movements  Boasian anthropology and the campaign against the concept of biologically based racial differences  Jewish involvement in the political Left  psychoanalysis  the Frankfurt School  the New York Intellectuals  U.S. immigration policy  and neoconservatism.  p    p  The end result of the triumph of these movements has been a tremendous increase in Jewish power and influence  and a concomitant decrease in the political and cultural power of Europeanderived peoplesethnic warfare by any other name . In general  this body of work is decidedly on the left  but a Left that is now fundamentally concerned with the dispossession of Europeans  rather than the classical Marxist emphasis on the class struggle . At the base of this activism is an understanding that the way to achieve their ethnic goals is to be able to control the culture . In reading the views of the Frankfurt School on the importance of cultural control  it struck me that those of us attempting to preserve the traditional peoples and culture of the West are in a similar situation to the Frankfurt School and the New York Intellectuals . Their complaints about the American culture of the s through the s are mirror images of the complaints that we have now.  p    p  Whereas the New York Intellectuals and the Frankfurt School felt alienated from the culture of the West  now we are the ones with feelings of alienation from the culture that has been so strongly influenced by these Jewish intellectual movements.  p    p  We are dismayed at the failure of the media to properly address White interests or even to allow expressions of White identity to be seen or heard in the mainstream media.  p    p  We are well aware that when there is a failure of media selfcensorship  there are powerful campaigns to punish the guilty parties and get them to recant.  p    p  Just as the Frankfurt School theorized  the West has come under the control of soft authoritarianism . But now the shoe is on the other foot  Power resides in the soft totalitarianism of the multicultural  multiracial  antiWhite Left.  p    p  Prior to their ascent to power  these intellectual movements decried the passivity  escapism  and conformity of American culture . Indeed  Tom Sunic mentions  the often stated European clich√© about the alleged American conformism.  Looking at the present situation  I would have to agree that Americans are conformists . Those of us who are White advocates are horrified that the vast majority of White Americans passively accept media messages filled with distorted images of Whites and their history . We are appalled that so many White Americans are far more interested in escapist entertainment  ranging from sporting events to scifi thrillers  than the future of their people . And we are dismayed by the conformity of the great mass of White Americans who are terrified of being called a  racist  or in any way violating the current taboos of political correctness . We deplore the pathetic conformists striving to uphold the rules of a society deeply hostile to their own longterm interests.  p    p  But is it really any different in Europe  Quite clearly we see the same conformity to the moral imperative of mass Third World immigration  multiculturalism  and the ideology that the traditional peoples and cultures of Europe have no legitimacy . For example  in Sweden there is enforced silence on any criticism of multiculturalism in the aboveground media . Discussing the cancellation of a talk because it was sponsored by a politically incorrect newspaper  Swedish journalist Ingrid Carlqvist comments   That  s the way it works in the New Sweden  the country I call Absurdistan . The country of silence.  Violating the silence is met with moral outrage intended to produce shunning and ostracism   p    p  The situation in Sweden is far worse than in Denmark . In Sweden NOBODY talks about immigration problems  the death of the multiculti project or the islamisation arabisation of Europe . If you do  you will immediately be called a racist  an Islamophobe or a Nazi . That is what I have been called since I founded the Free Press Society in Sweden . My name has been dragged through the dirt in big newspapers like Sydsvenskan  Svenska Dagbladet and even my own union paper  The Journalist.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  In Sweden  as in America  having a nonconforming opinions immediately results in ostracism as a moral reprobate.  p    p  Rather than see a culture controlled by the  late capitalist  media   White advocates see the culture of the West as controlled by a hostile media elite that advocates multiculturalism  the displacement of Whites  and the culture of Western suicide.  p    p  There is thus a common thread between these Jewish intellectual movements and those of us attempting to preserve the traditional people and culture of the West . We all agree in the importance of media control . Paraphrasing a Bill Clinton campaign slogan   It  s the culture  stupid.   p    p  Control of the media is critical . If there were strong media messages advocating White identity and the legitimacy of White interests  things would turn around rather dramatically and rather quickly . This is because the psychological power behind a movement of ethnic defense is far greater than the motivation that can be mustered for a multiracial  multiethnic communist revolution.  p    p  Such media messages would be able to tap into the natural wellspring of ethnic feeling . There is a deep psychological attachment to one  s people and cultureeven among us individualistic White peoplethat can easily motivate a mass movement of ethnic defense.  p    p  Often these feelings are implicit and unconscious rather than explicit and conscious . They manifest themselves in moving to neighborhoods where their children can attend school with other Whites . Or they manifest themselves in activities where they are able to enjoy the company and camaraderie of others like themselves.  p    p  These feelings are real . And they are potentially very powerful . The revolution needed to reverse the cultural tides of the last decades would therefore be far easier to pull off than the Marxist one so ardently deasired by the Frankfurt School.  p    p  Because the Jewish community has been so intimately involved in creating the therapeutic state  it is noteworthy to examine how the Jewish community responds to breaches of decorumthat is  to challenges to its hegemony . Here  the methods are quite similar to those used in postWorld War II Germany  as described by Sunic   p    p  When silencing their critics  the German authorities do not need to resort to violent means . They usually create a cultural smearing campaign whereby a cultural heretic is portrayed as a funny  pseudoscientific crank who does not merit a place in mainstream publishing houses . Moreover  the heretic is often induced into a selfmuzzling behavior making impossible any portrayal of himself as a martyr.  p    p  A good example is the response to the unflattering portrayal of the Israel Lobby by John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  The power of the Israel Lobby is legendary and has had a major effect on U.S. foreign policy  including the recent war in Iraq . The typical response has included an argument or two aimed at small pieces of the edifice erected by Mearsheimer and Walt  but the real common denominators are intimidation  guiltbyassociation  and charges of antiSemitism . The guiltbyassociation tactic appeared in the very earliest media accounts of the article and has continued to be invoked regularly . For example  David Duke has been repeatedly cited as supporting Mearsheimer and Walt . Alan Dershowitz  s page rebuttal of Mearsheimer and Walt contains no less than  references to David Duke and five references comparing Mearsheimer and Walt  s article to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  Charges of antiSemitism abound . This occurs despite the fact that David Duke is never cited as a source on foreign policy issues or anything else in the mainstream media . However  since Duke is an activist on behalf of EuropeanAmericans who is regularly linked in the media with the Ku Klux Klan  Nazism  and  White supremacy   the technique works to marginalize the work of Mearsheimer and Walteven though Mearsheimer and Walt have performed the ritual denunciation of Duke.  p    p  The sad reality is that discussing a whole host of issues related to Jews  even in a rational  informed manner  brings charges of antiSemitism and incompetent scholarship ringing down from the highest reaches of academia and the elite media . One can easily see that this is a recipe for paranoia  frustration and ultimately antiSemitism.  p    p  But the tactics of the Jewish intellectual and political infrastructure are effective because  even if they create dark suspicions about the behavior of the organized Jewish community among a few  and vague twinges of anxiety among many  these attitudes are forced to remain underground . They occur in the privacy of one  s thoughts or in guarded conversations and coded emails . And because there is more than a grain of truth to these attitudes  for some they readily give rise to apocalyptic  impossible conspiracy theories . After all  if the reality of Jewish power on issues such as Israel is as plain as the nose on your face  and you know that this power is ultimately maintained by intimidation  smear tactics  and endlessly repeated propaganda emanating from the mainstream media and elite academic institutions  at some point informed people start thinking that there  s probably a whole lot else they aren  t being told.  p    p  There is an old saying that  sticks and stones can break my bones  but words can never hurt me.  The sad reality is  however  that the vast majority of Americans in politics  the media  and academia are terrified of being labeled an antiSemite or compared to bogey men or infamous books to which they have no connection .  Obviously  the same can be said for Europeans .  This is ironic  at the least  in the case of academics  who cultivate an image of being apolitical  fearless truthseekers . Unlike politicians  who must continue to curry favor with the public in order to be reelected  and unlike media figures who have little job security  academics with tenure have no excuse for not being willing to endure labels such as  antiSemite  or  racist  in order to pursue the truth . A large part of the rationale for tenure in the first place is that academics are supposed to be willing to take unpopular positions  to forge ahead using all their brain power and expertise to chart new territories that challenge popular wisdom.  p    p  But that image of academia is simply not based in reality  as shown by an article appearing almost two months after the publication of Mearsheimer and Walt  s essay and appropriately titled  A hot paper muzzles academia.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  Instead of a roiling debate  most professors not only agreed to disagree but agreed to pretend publicly that there was no disagreement at all . At Harvard and other schools  the MearsheimerWalt paper proved simply too hot to handle and it revealed an academia deeply split yet lamentably afraid to engage itself on one of the hottest political issues of our time . Call it the academic Cold War  distrustful factions rendered timid by the prospect of mutually assured Professors refused to take a stand on the paper  either in favor or against . As one Ivy League professor noted   A lot of  my colleagues  were more concerned about the academic politics of it  and where they should come down  in that sense.   p    p  Bear in mind that the vast majority of the professors unwilling to take a stand on this issue have tenure and literally can not be fired . They are afraid not of starvation but of having their career ruined by being associated with the wrong side in this debate . The downside is that they won  t be invited to deliver papers at other universities or important conferences . They will not be able to publish their work at prestigious academic or commercial presses  or they may even have difficulty having their work published at all . They won  t be invited to the good parties or get nice summer fellowships or get asked to serve as dean or in a future administration in Washington . Or maybe their sources of funding would dry up.  p    p  And it  s pretty clear that the  wrong side  of this debate is to express publicly approval of a paper that has been denounced in the elite media as  antiSemitic.  Can anyone believe that the Alan Dershowitzes of the world are not taking names and will not hold dissidents accountable   p    p  It  s not that professors don  t want to opine on publicpolicy issues . When there are opportunities to spout righteous leftism  professors leap to the front of the line . A good example is a recent case where three White men from the Duke University lacrosse team allegedly gangraped  sodomized  and choked a black woman who had been hired as a stripper for a party.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  Despite considerable evidence that the charges were spurious  three academic departments   programs  and  professors at Duke bought an ad in the campus newspaper in which they asserted the guilt of the men and stated that  what happened to this young woman  resulted from  racism and sexism.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  But  of course  in this case  the professors who went public with their indignation knew they were part of a likeminded community and that there would be much to gain by being on the politically correct side  and little to lose if they were proven wrong  . Indeed  a university committee charged with looking into the response of the Duke administration to this incident recommended hiring more minorities in order to increase the diversity of the Duke administration.  p    p  Sadly  there is now a great deal of evidence that academics in general are careful to avoid controversy or do much of anything that will create hostility . In fact  some researchers are pointing to this fact to call into question whether tenure is justified . A recent survey of the attitudes of  professors at elite universities illustrates this quite clearly.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  Regardless of their rank  professors rated their  br  colleagues as  p    p  reluctant to engage in activities that ran counter to the wishes of colleagues . Even tenured full professors believed  other full professors  would invoke academic freedom only  sometimes  rather than  usually  or  always   they chose confrontational options  rarely   albeit more often than did lower ranked colleagues . . . . Their willingness to selflimit may be due to a desire for harmony andor respect for the criticisms of colleagues whose opinions they value . Thus  the data did not support the depiction of Professorus Americanus as unleashed renegade.  p    p  Seen in this context  the reaction to Mearsheimer and Walt makes a lot of sense . As one professor noted   People might debate it if you gave everyone a getoutofjailfree card and promised that afterwards everyone would be friends.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  This intense desire to be accepted and liked by one  s colleagues is certainly understandable . It is probably part of human nature . There have been times when I have had to endure charges of antiSemitism  most recently in an article by Jacob Laksin titled  Cal State  s Professor of AntiSemitism   published by David Horowitz  s FrontPageMagazine.com.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  It  s perhaps worth nothing that the same webzine also published perhaps the most vitriolic antiMearsheimer and Walt piece to date  Abraham H. Miller  s  The New Protocols.   Miller begins by stating  Professors Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer  s recently disseminated antiSemitic screed has been ripped apart by both prominent scholars and literary figures showing it to be an intellectual fraud being passed off as serious scholarship.  The essay ends with  AntiSemites have now found the new  em  Protocols of the Elders of Zion  em  .    p    p  It didn  t really bother me much that such an article was published if the discussion was confined to the impersonal world of the Internet . I would write a detailed reply and circulate it among the people who read my stuff  and I knew that people who support my writing would rally to my defense and say nice things about me and my reply to Laksin . And I knew that I would get a few pieces of hate mail and maybe a couple of death threats  but that is to be expected . And it  s all rather abstract  since I basically sit in solitude at my computer and read it all  and it pretty much ends there . Frankly  there is a part of me that feels good about it  I hope that the word is getting out  even if by means of an attack piece.  p    p  The point is that when this article came out  almost all my anxiety stemmed from worries that the article would be picked up by people on my campus or in professional organizations in which I am involved . I wasn  t worried that I would lose my job  although Laksin was clearly upset about California State University  s  ignoring altogether the question of why it considers the manufacture of stylized bigotry an appropriate avocation for a tenured scholar.  What I dreaded was coming into my office and being greeted by cold shoulders and hostile stares  by colleagues not wanting to go to lunch or nervously looking away when I passed in the hall . I worried about reading sensationalistic articles in the campus newspaper.  p    p  I imagined going to academic conferences and receiving the same sort of reception . I worried that people wouldn  t invite me to write academic papers or wouldn  t cite my writing in other areas not related to Jewish issues.  p    p  This little bit of personal experience is doubtless typical of the forces of selfcensorship that maintain the political order of the postWorld War II West . It  s the concern about the facetoface consequences of being a nonconformist in the deeply sensitive areas related to race or to Jewish influence.  p    p  Consider the response of Anne Morrow Lindbergh to the torrent of abuse heaped upon her husband  Charles Lindbergh  for stating that Jews were one force promoting war against Germany in  . The speech threw her into  dark gloom    p    p  Will I be able to shop in New York at all now  I am always stared atbut now to be stared at with hate  to walk through aisles of hate    sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  Again  what is most feared is the personal  facetoface contact . As an evolutionary psychologist  it  s tempting to speculate that our evolved psychological mechanisms are triggered far more by the close and personal context of day to day interactions  not in the cold and impersonal world of communicating on the Internet.  p    p  And it  s not just that it is in the facetoface world of everyday life . It is that the areas of nonconformity we are talking about here have huge moral overtones . If one dissents from the reigning theory of macroeconomics or the main influences on th century French Romanticism  one may be viewed as a bit eccentric or perhaps ill informed . But one is not likely to be viewed as a moral reprobate . One is not likely to be subjected to torrents of moral outrage.  p    p  Evolutionary theorist Robert Trivers has proposed that the emotion of guilt is a sign to the group that a person will mend his ways and behave in the future  whereas shame functions as a display of submission to people higher in the dominance hierarchy . From that perspective  a person who is incapable of shame or guilt even for obvious transgressions is literally a sociopathsomeone who has no desire to fit into group norms . Such sociopathy would usually be a death sentence in the small groups that we humans evolved in . Only the most dominant individuals would be able to resist the moral outrage of the group  and even they must be concerned about coalitions rising against them.  p    p  What is striking  and perhaps counterintuitive  is that the guilt and shame remain even when we are completely satisfied at an intellectual level that our beliefs are based on good evidence and reasonable inferences . Anne Morrow Lindbergh writes   p    p  I can not explain my revulsion of feeling by logic . Is it my lack of courage to face the problem  Is it my lack of vision and seeing the thing through  Or is my intuition founded on something profound and valid  I do not know and am only very disturbed  which is upsetting for him . I have the greatest faith in him as a personin his integrity  his courage  and his essential goodness  fairness  and kindnesshis nobility really . . . . How then explain my profound feeling of grief about what he is doing  If what he said is the truth  and I am inclined to think it is   why was it wrong to state it    sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  Her reaction is involuntary and irrationalbeyond the reach of logical analysis . Charles Lindbergh was exactly right in what he said  but a rational understanding of the correctness of his analysis can not lessen the psychological trauma to his wife who must face the hostile stares of others . In psychological terms  the trauma is the result of implicit  unconscious processes stemming from our evolved psychology and a long history of successful socialization.  p    p  The preceding discusses the  push  of movements that have attempted to alter American and other Europeanderived societies into defenseless entities with no ethnic or cultural identity . But the other side of the equation must also be examinedthe traits that predispose Westerners to accept their own oblivion as a moral necessity . Here  Sunic emphasizes the heritage of Christian universalism and  especially in the case of America  the heritage of Puritan moralism.  p    p  Several writers have discussed the Puritan spirit  which combined of egalitarianism and democracy  religious hierarchy  and  sometimes violent  crusades against immorality.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  In the th century  Puritan areas had low levels of personal violence but the highest levels of  em  public  em  violence directed at heretics and those suspected of witchcraft . I have suggested that this emphasis on relative egalitarianism and consensual  democratic government are tendencies characteristic of Northern European peoples as a result of a prolonged evolutionary history as huntergatherers in cold  harsh environments.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  But the Puritans added a high degree of group cohesion  made possible by a powerful emphasis on cultural conformity  e.g.  punishment of religious heresy  and public regulation of personal behavior related to sex  fornication  adultery   public drunkenness  etc . One might say that the Puritans tried to square the circle by combining egalitarianism and democracyboth strongly associated with individualismwith high levels of cultural control  a collectivist trait.  p    p  But as Sunic emphasizes  it is the Puritan tendency to pursue utopian causes framed as moral issues that stands outtheir susceptibility to utopian appeals to a  higher law  and the belief that the principal purpose of government is moral . New England was the most fertile ground for  the perfectibility of man creed  and was the  father of a dozen  isms.    sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  There was a tendency to paint political alternatives as starkly contrasting moral imperatives  with one side portrayed as evil incarnateinspired by the devil . Puritan moral intensity can also be seen in their  profound personal piety   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  their intensity of commitment to live not only a holy life but also a sober and industrious life.  p    p  Puritans waged holy war on behalf of moral righteousness even against their own cousins . Whatever the political and economic complexities that led to the Civil War  it was the Yankee moral condemnation of slavery that inspired the rhetoric and rendered the massive carnage of closely related AngloAmericans  on behalf of slaves from Africa  justifiable in the minds of Puritans . Militarily . The war with the Confederacy rendered the heaviest sacrifice in lives and property ever made by Americans.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  This Puritan moral fervor  and its tendency to justify draconian punishment of  evildoers   can also be seen in the comments of the Congregationalist minister at Henry Ward Beecher  s Old Plymouth Church in New York  who called for  exterminating the German people . . . the sterilization of  German soldiers and the segregation of the woman.   sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup   p    p  This Puritan moralism and its deep roots in America account for the importance of moral legitimacy in maintaining the current cultural regime . Anne Morrow Lindbergh  in expressing her thoughts on her husband  s controversial speech  related   p    p  I would prefer to see this country at war than shaken by violent antiSemitism .  Because it seems to me that the kind of person the human being is turned into when the instinct of Jewbaiting is let loose is worse than the kind of person he becomes on the battlefield .   p    p  In other words  the thought that even a disastrous war that might kill hundreds of thousands of Americans  and  as her husband believed  might result in the destruction of European culture and the White race  is preferable to the possibility of an outbreak of violent antiSemitism . For Puritansatheart like Mrs. Lindbergh  the moral demeanor of Americans is more important than their survival.  p    p  Elsewhere I have argued that this tendency toward moralistic punishment is a form of  altruistic punishment  described recently by research on group behavior in individualistic cultures.  sup   a class  footnote  href   fn  id  fnr  title  see footnote       a   sup  Because Europeans are individualists at heart  they readily rise up in moral anger against their own people once they are seen as morally blameworthya manifestation of their much stronger tendency toward altruistic punishment deriving from their evolutionary past as huntergatherers . But these tendencies are also present among Europeans  as the example from Sweden discussed above indicates.  p    p  Hence the current moralistic crusade of the Left so characteristic of contemporary Western civilization  Once Europeans were convinced that their own people were morally bankrupt  any and all means of punishment should be used against their own people . A major theme of The Culture of Critique is that the most influential intellectual and political movements of the th century presented European civilization as morally bankrupt and the proper target of moralistic punishment . Western culture had become the culture of guilt whose central icon had become the Holocaust and African slavery.  p    p  The forces maintaining the current cultural regime are multilayered . Because this culture of guilt has seized control of the pinnacles of moral and intellectual authority  resistance carries huge costs  which go far beyond practical considerations like keeping one  s job.The costs are also psychological and deeply personal.  p    p  But resistance does serve a function . As Sunic notes  there is a real prospect of social breakdown given the increasing ethnic divisions in the United States . In The Culture of Critique  I predicted that the current regime would lead to increased ethnic strife and an increased sense of group consciousness among European peoples . As an evolutionist  it is difficult for me to believe that a racial group would be unconcerned with its own eclipse and domination.  p    p  I believe that in the United States we are presently heading down a volatile patha path that leads to ethnic warfare and to the development of collectivist  authoritarian  and racialist enclaves . Although ethnocentric beliefs and behavior are viewed as morally and intellectually legitimate only among ethnic minorities . . . the development of greater ethnocentrism among Europeanderived peoples is a likely result of present trends . . . .  br   E  thnocentrism on the part of the Europeanderived majority in the United States is a likely outcome of the increasingly groupstructured contemporary social and political landscapelikely because evolved psychological mechanisms in humans appear to function by making ingroup and outgroup membership more salient in situations of groupbased resource competition . The effort to overcome these inclinations thus necessitates applying to Western societies a massive  therapeutic  intervention in which manifestations of majoritarian ethnocentrism are combated at several levels  but first and foremost by promoting the ideology that such manifestations are an indication of psychopathology and a cause for ostracism  shame  psychiatric intervention  and counseling . One may expect that as ethnic conflict continues to escalate in the United States  increasingly desperate attempts will be made to prop up the ideology of multiculturalism with sophisticated theories of the psychopathology of majority group ethnocentrism  as well as with the erection of police state controls on nonconforming thought and behavior.  p    p  At some point the negative consequences to the European population of the U.S. of multicultural ideology and massive influx of other peoples will become so obvious that current levels of control will be ineffective . We will be in a situation similar to that of the Soviet Union  when it became  in Sunic  s words   a makebelieve system nobody truly believed in and a state everybody  including former Communist party dignitaries  made fun of in private.  p    p  And if at this point  Europeans stare into the abyss and voluntarily cede political and cultural power  they will have no one to blame but themselves . And they will be cursed by their descendants . Perhaps they will one day read Tomislav Sunic  s excellent book and think about what might have been.  p    p   strong  KEVIN MACDONALD  strong  is Professor of Psychology at California State UniversityLong Beach .

On the popular blog of the altright publisher CounterCurrents  the world of Austen  s novels is extolled as a prototype for the  racial dictatorship  of tomorrow .

Fervent patriotism is invoked sardonically rather than earnestly proclaimed  Upon his first visit to his father  s estate in the small town of Highbury  Frank Churchill archly states that he will prove that he  belong  s  to the place  and is a  true citizen.

In a post that debuted in  on Alternative Right and has since been lauded as an altright  classic   the  manosphere  blogger Matt Forney mentioned Austen as an outlier from the norm of female mediocrity   Virtually all great leaders  thinkers and artists were men .
